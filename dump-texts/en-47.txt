Pride

   The feeling when you possess or have accomplished something that other
   people find praiseworthy. You feel vigorous and have the urge to show
   off to others.

   Pride is primarily about yourself, even when it is not you who did
   something that you are proud about. You can also be proud of something
   someone else did, who you associate with, such as your children or your
   favorite football team. People can feel proud of their culture, their
   family name, or their appearance, none of which require them to
   actively contribute to the praiseworthy thing^1. However, the opinions
   of others are of crucial importance, as best demonstrated when you
   purposefully do something that other people praise.

   Pride is a social emotion, and to feel proud, you need other people’s
   (real or imagined) confirmation that you have a reason to feel that
   way. Because of this, other people can also ‘be in your head’ and
   prevent you from feeling pride. Namely, what is praiseworthy is
   subjective. Things that may be considered good in a certain (cultural)
   group may not be praiseworthy in another (e.g., if you grew up in a
   family that greatly values academics, your athletic abilities may not
   evoke much praise). Moreover, what is praiseworthy is relative (e.g.,
   if you are a good runner in an athletically average school, you may
   regularly feel proud about your times; but if you move to a school with
   highly competent athletes, these same times may seem unremarkable to
   you). Thus, the more exclusive your quality is in your surroundings,
   the prouder you feel.

   Pride has recognizable features. Although its static facial expression
   (typically a smile or laugh) does not clearly distinguish it from other
   positive emotions, it typically results in a bodily posture, gestures,
   and behavior that are clearly recognizable: lifting your chin, looking
   people in the eye, walking confidently, or in extreme cases, raising
   arms above your head. In a way, you try to make yourself larger and
   more noticeable, as if to say: ‘look at me!’ You may also exhibit more
   perseverance in your activities^2.

   People generally find it very pleasant to experience pride, as it
   elevates our feeling of social self-worth and status^3. At the same
   time, many social groups, religions, and cultures (especially those
   that are highly collectivistic, such as the East Asian or African
   culture) believe that pride needs to be checked. Unchecked pride leads
   to arrogance and misplaced feelings of superiority (‘letting something
   get to your head’, ‘hubris comes before the fall’), and social groups
   typically do not tolerate members feeling like they are superior or
   deserve special treatment.
