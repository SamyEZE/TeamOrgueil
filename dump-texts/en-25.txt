   Hempstead, NY - Hofstra University Head Women's Tennis Coach Tripp Tuff
   announced today three outstanding student-athletes who will serve as
   captains for the Pride during their 2024 season.
   Earning this incredible leadership role are: Kaitlyn Ferguson, Deniz
   Soyer, and Lea Forste-Dinell.
   "These three young women represent the change we are implementing
   within the Hofstra women's tennis program," commented Tuff. "They are
   dedicated to the process and possess a team above self mentality, which
   are qualities I know will help take this program in a positive
   direction on and off the court."
   Ferguson, a junior from Lantana, Texas, led the team in singles
   victories during her first year with the Pride. She has been named to
   Hofstra's Dean's List, the CAA Commissioner's Academic Honor Roll, and
   an ITA Scholar-Athlete each of her last two years at Hofstra.
   A junior from Basildon, England, Soyer has compiled a career 11-32
   record in singles play and a 16-29 record in doubles. Soyer has been
   named to the Hofstra Athletic Director Scholars, and CAA Commissioner's
   Academic Honor Rolls each year, and has earned recognition as an ITA
   Scholar Athlete.
   Forste-Dinell, a junior from Stockholm, Sweden, joined the Pride this
   year after two seasons at the University of Illinois Chicago. There
   Forste-Dinell complied a career 20-18 record in singles and a career
   5-14 record in doubles play. She was named a 2023 ITA Scholar-Athlete
   while in Chicago.
