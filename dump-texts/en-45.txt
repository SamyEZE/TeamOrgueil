Descendants of Black Civil War Heroes Wear Their Heritage With Pride

   A bold new photographic project asks modern-day Americans to recreate
   portraits of their 19th-century ancestors in painstakingly accurate
   fashion

   Text by Jennie Rothenberg Gritz

   Neikoye Flowers was in second grade when he came home and asked his
   mother about his ancestors. His classmates had been sharing family
   stories—perhaps they were Irish, or Italian, or descended from Native
   Americans. Neikoye’s mother, Janisse, wasn’t sure what to say: “I told
   him, ‘I know bits and pieces, but I can’t give you a full rundown,
   aside from: We’re Black.’”

   So she was taken aback a year later when a British man named Drew
   Gardner called and informed her that she was descended from a member of
   the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the all-Black Civil War unit
   featured in the movie Glory. “It seemed like a scam,” she says. A bit
   of research confirmed that Gardner was who he claimed to be—an
   award-winning British photographer who has spent nearly 20 years
   tracking down descendants of notable people and asking them to pose for
   recreated portraits of their famous ancestors.

   Janisse studied the sepia-toned photo Gardner had sent of her
   great-great-grandfather, David Miles Moore Jr. When Moore enlisted in
   April 1863, he gave his age as 16, but he was likely younger. The photo
   showed him with a baby face, holding a drum almost a third of his
   height. He looked a lot like Neikoye.

   Now it’s a warm day in 2023, and 9-year-old Neikoye is sitting on a
   couch wearing a dark blue Civil War uniform, playing iPad games with
   his twin sister, Judah. People of various ages are milling around the
   room looking like time travelers. There’s a college soccer player from
   Alabama, dressed in the same type of uniform as his ancestor Lewis
   Douglass. There’s a medical researcher from Upstate New York having her
   hair styled so she can recreate a portrait of her
   great-great-great-aunt Harriet Tubman.

   Even the camera looks like a visitor from another era. Gardner always
   goes to great lengths to recreate the original portraits, hiring prop
   specialists to track down furniture and fabrics from earlier centuries
   and having wigs and costumes specially made. But this is the first time
   he’s chosen to use period technology for a Descendants shoot. The room
   where everyone is gathered today is the Penumbra Tintype Portrait
   Studio in Midtown Manhattan, one of the rare studios that specialize in
   the kind of wet-plate collodion photography used during the Civil War.

   When it’s time to take Neikoye’s picture, Gardner calls out in his
   British accent, “Quiet on the set, please! Complete quiet!” The
   conversation stops, and everyone turns to watch Gardner slip a
   lacquered slide into the camera. He takes off the lens cap, fixes his
   eyes on a stopwatch and counts out loud to seven—then pulls out the
   plate and rushes downstairs to the darkroom. He and Sam Dole, an
   instructor and portrait maker at Penumbra, watch intently as the image
   of the drummer boy starts to appear in the photo tray. “That looks
   good,” Gardner proclaims with relief. “Yeah, we smashed it.”

   Gardner started photographing American descendants a few years ago,
   partly because he was losing interest in British ones. He’d already
   recreated portraits with descendants of Charles II, Oliver Cromwell,
   Charles Dickens, Horatio Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, William
   Wordsworth and Napoleon Bonaparte. “At a certain point,” he says, “I
   looked at all the portraits I’d shot and realized they were nearly all
   of white men.”

   In 2020, Smithsonian commissioned a U.S. installment of Gardner’s
   project, featuring descendants of Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Cady
   Stanton, as well as a Black descendant of Thomas Jefferson. “I really
   loved doing it,” Gardner says. “Then I started to think, ‘Well, it’s
   all very well and good that I’m telling stories about people who are
   well known, but what about the people who aren’t well known but have
   played an amazing part in American history?’”

   As a white Englishman, Gardner has his own connection to America’s
   origins: His country abducted about three million Africans, chained and
   forcibly transported them across the Atlantic to labor in British
   colonies. Gardner started thinking about the descendants of these
   enslaved people and how he could help bring their stories to light.
   “The starting point for these Descendants shoots is usually, ‘Are they
   descended from people the public would know?’” he says. “This is the
   first time I’ve flipped the project to say, ‘These are people you
   should really know about.’”

   He and his researcher, Ottawa Goodman, decided to look for descendants
   of Black Civil War heroes. It wasn’t hard to locate relatives of
   Harriet Tubman, a figure widely known for ferrying enslaved people to
   freedom but less known for her role as a spy during the war. It was
   likewise easy to find descendants of Lewis Douglass, a sergeant major
   in the U.S. Army who wasn’t famous in his own right but was the son of
   the famed Frederick Douglass. After that, the task got much more
   challenging.

   Louis Troutman was a member of the 108th Regiment of the United States
   Colored Infantry. The unit, formed in Kentucky, was composed mainly of
   formerly enslaved Black men. Thomas Harris Collection Christopher
   Wilson Troutman's descendant Christopher Wilson says the U.S. Army
   “very purposefully and strategically” put his ancestor’s unit in charge
   of guarding Confederate prisoners. “The visuals were really important,”
   he says. Drew Gardner

   White Americans more often know when they’re related to anyone even
   slightly remarkable. Many white genealogy buffs can trace their family
   trees all the way back to Huguenot rebels or Scottish chieftains. The
   information they’re seeking—such as names, dates, places of residence
   and family connections—is often available in the form of birth and
   death certificates, immigration records, marriage licenses, baptism
   records or U.S. census listings. Because so much of this information is
   easy to access, a white ancestry-seeker might go out looking for
   information and find pre-existing trees created by distant relatives.

   But Black families tend to know far less about their ancestors, and
   what they do pass down within families often isn’t published online.
   Emmaline MacBeath, a genealogist at the collaborative genealogy website
   WikiTree, says there are far fewer user-generated family trees for
   African Americans than there are for white people. One reason is that
   records of enslaved people are hard to navigate. “You have to be
   creative to find things using many different spellings, different
   birthdays,” she says. “And you have to study entire communities at a
   time. On slave schedules, there were just tick marks on a page—there
   were no names. So, how do we take this list of 200 ages, with no other
   information, and turn it into a list of actual people?”

   There’s also the fact that many African Americans haven’t publicized
   their family trees because they preferred to keep that information
   private. When Janisse mentioned Gardner’s message to an elderly aunt,
   she discovered that her aunt knew all about their Civil War ancestor.
   But she’d never said a word about it. “Back when my aunt was growing
   up, it wasn’t something to brag about,” Janisse says. “It was something
   that put a red flag on you, made you stand out in a way.” Like many
   African Americans, her aunt had internalized the message that life is
   safest for Black people who live quietly and humbly, without attracting
   attention or challenging the ways white people choose to think about
   the past.
   Lewis Douglas Frederick Douglass’s son Lewis Douglass, a sergeant
   major. Lewis joined the military as part of a wave of Black men who
   sought to prove, as his father said, that they were not the "craven
   cowards, without soul, without manhood, without the spirit of soldiers"
   that Confederates slandered them as. National Park Services Austin
   Morris Austin Morris, a college soccer player in Alabama, was always
   aware that he was descended from the great American writer and orator
   Frederick Douglass. But the Descendants project gave him a deeper sense
   of connection to Frederick’s son Lewis Douglass, one of the first
   African Americans to enlist in the Civil War. Drew Gardner

   “These are families who have always been told, ‘American history has
   nothing to do with you,’” Gardner says. “No one talks about the price
   their families paid, not only for their own freedom but for the future
   of America itself.”

   In the case of the Flowers family, Gardner and his researchers started
   out with David Miles Moore Jr. They were able to find records that
   included a filing for a military pension, dated October 18, 1897, and a
   mention in the U.S. census from 1900. That information helped them
   identify his offspring. As they worked their way down the family line,
   obituaries helped them find the names of grandchildren and
   great-grandchildren. Once the researchers found Janisse’s name, it
   wasn’t hard to find pictures of her family. She and her husband, Neiko,
   hosted a radio show and regularly featured their children on their
   public Instagram feed.

   Janisse and Neiko talked things over for a while before they agreed to
   let Neikoye take part. “He was the right age, the right height,” says
   Janisse. “Let him recreate that photo. Let him have this experience. He
   wanted to know about his history. So let’s do a deep dive into it.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   When the Civil War began in April 1861, the U.S. didn’t allow Black men
   to join the armed forces. Fredrick Douglass published an essay in his
   publication Douglass’ Monthly. “Why does the government reject the
   Negro?” he wrote. “Is he not a man? Can he not wield a sword, fire a
   gun, march and countermarch, and obey orders like any other?” Excluding
   Black men seemed to Douglass like a concession to the enemy. “The
   national edifice is on fire. Every man who can carry a bucket of water,
   or remove a brick, is wanted; but those who have the care of the
   building, having a profound respect for the feeling of the national
   burglars who set the building on fire, are determined that the flames
   shall only be extinguished by Indo-Caucasian hands, and to have the
   building burnt rather than save it by means of any other. Such is the
   pride, the stupid prejudice and folly that rules the hour.”

   The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, opened the way for
   Black men to enlist. The proclamation ensured that the military would
   “recognize and maintain the freedom” of African Americans and do
   nothing to stand in the way of “any efforts they may make for their
   actual freedom.” With that, the U.S. military went from excluding Black
   men to actively recruiting them.

   Douglass played an enthusiastic role. In March 1863, he published a
   broadside titled: “Men of Color, to Arms! Now or Never!” He wrote that
   slaveholders had made Black men out to be “craven cowards, without
   soul, without manhood, without the spirit of soldiers.” The only way to
   prove them wrong was to join up: “If we are not lower in the scale of
   humanity than Englishmen, Irishmen, white Americans and other races, we
   can show it now.”

   This was one reason the Confederates didn’t want to enlist Black men
   (along with the obvious potential repercussions of arming the people
   they’d been enslaving). In the last few desperate weeks of the war, the
   South did enlist a few thousand Black soldiers, but only after much
   debate. “I think that the proposition to make soldiers of our slaves is
   the most pernicious idea that has been suggested since the war began,”
   the Confederate politician and military leader Howell Cobb wrote in a
   January 1865 letter to the Confederate secretary of war. “If slaves
   will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.”

   This was exactly what Douglass wanted to prove. All over the North,
   Black men rushed to answer the call. By the end of the war, 179,000
   African Americans had served in the U.S. Army, making up 10 percent,
   and another 19,000 had joined the Navy. Douglass’ sons Lewis and
   Charles were among the first to enlist.

   At the studio in Manhattan, Austin Morris, a 20-year-old Division 1
   soccer player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is getting
   ready to recreate a portrait of Lewis Douglass. Morris has always known
   he was descended from Frederick Douglass, though he keeps a low profile
   about it. “I’m never going to be like, ‘Oh, look at me,’” he says
   shyly. “I tell my close friends, but I don’t really like all the
   attention.”

   It felt different to dress up like Lewis. “I was looking at his
   picture, thinking: I’m 20. He was in his 20s when the picture was
   taken. He fought in the war, and he was one of the first Blacks to sign
   up for it. That’s crazy. I couldn’t imagine doing that.” Wearing a
   uniform like his ancestor wore, its sleeves marked with the insignia of
   a sergeant major, Morris reflects on his own ambitions. “It makes me
   feel like I need to make them proud, to carry on their legacy,” he
   says, “to do things that will honor our family.”
   Harriet Tubman Famed liberator Harriet Tubman also spied on the South
   during the Civil War. On June 2, 1863, she led U.S. troops to a spot in
   South Carolina where they set fire to plantations, allowing hundreds of
   enslaved laborers to flee. Library of Congress Deanna Walz To recreate
   this photo with descendant Deanna Walz, the photographer enlisted the
   help of a Netflix costumer. Tubman owned a few elegant pieces,
   including a lace shawl from Queen Victoria that’s now in the
   Smithsonian’s collections. Drew Gardner

   None of the men in uniform today has ever served in the military, but
   many of their relatives have. Charles and Joan Miller are here with
   their adult son, Jared, who is dressed like his Civil War ancestor
   Richard Oliver. Jared wears a slouchy dark blue Civil War forage cap on
   his head. Charles wears a baseball cap with the words “Thomas Edison 64
   Vietnam.” “I went to Edison High School in Philadelphia, and we had the
   highest casualties of any school in America,” Charles says. The 64
   refers to the number of boys from his almost entirely African American
   school who died in a war many of them saw as irrelevant to their lives.
   Charles himself tore up his paperwork from the Selective Service when
   it first arrived, but after the police spotted him in the park singing
   doo-wop songs with his friends, they loaded the young men into a police
   van and brought them before the draft board. With help from a family
   friend, he was able to enlist in the Navy instead of the Marines, and
   he spent the war years serving in the Caribbean instead of Southeast
   Asia.

   Nobody had to draft Richard Oliver into the Civil War. The 31-year-old
   Black laborer from Upstate New York volunteered the day after Christmas
   in 1863, leaving his wife and two children and traveling south with the
   20th Colored Infantry. Although Oliver survived the war, he died of
   malaria on the journey home and never saw his family again.

   A framed portrait of Oliver made its way down through the generations
   until it ended up in the hands of Charles’ wife, Joan. No one in her
   family knew the identity of the young man gazing earnestly into the
   camera. Eventually, the Millers connected with a local historian and
   learned that the man was Joan’s great-great-grandfather. A local
   newspaper covered the story. “I feel humbled by it, really,” Joan says.
   “Because I didn’t know who the soldier in this picture was. And when I
   found out it’s like—wow. You know? I can trace back to him. What a
   wonderful feeling.”
   Andrew Jackson Smith Civil War hero Andrew Jackson Smith was awarded a
   posthumous medal of honor for risking his life to carry a fallen
   American flag during the 1864 Battle of Honey Hill. State Library of
   Massachusetts Kwesi Bowman “My granddad has the medal at his house,”
   said Smith’s descendant Kwesi Bowman. “I wish he was here, but he just
   had surgery, so he couldn’t make it. I’m doing this for him.” Drew
   Gardner

   Christopher Wilson is marching around the room with a replica of an
   1853 Enfield rifle in the crook of his right arm. “I actually grew up
   with one of these. We had one over our fireplace in Detroit. And every
   time my parents weren’t home,” he adds, “I’d take it down and play
   Civil War in the living room.”

   Wilson is the director of experience design at the National Museum of
   American History, but he’s here today because he’s the
   great-great-grandson of Louis Troutman, a private in the 108th Regiment
   of the U.S. Colored Infantry. The unit, formed in Kentucky in 1864, was
   made up mostly of formerly enslaved Black men.

   Wilson’s main associations with the military came from his father, a
   veteran of World War II. While his father was training at Fort
   McClellan in Alabama, he and a few friends crossed paths with the local
   sheriff, who was riding around with some military personnel. The
   sheriff pointed a Thompson submachine gun at the young Black men. “Now,
   I know you boys are new here,” the sheriff said. “I don’t want to see
   any of you walking in groups of more than two down my streets.”
   Wilson’s father never forgot that moment. “He’s an American soldier,
   potentially about to give his life for his country,” he says. “I think
   he was really tempered by that.”

   Wilson has given a lot of thought to the way Americans talk about
   military history. He notes that the tradition of referring to one side
   in the Civil War as “the Union” and the other side as “the Confederacy”
   makes the two seem equivalent, like sports teams in different jerseys,
   instead of a sovereign nation fighting a group of insurgents. And while
   the war did set brother against brother—“One wore blue and one wore
   gray,” as the song goes—the institution of slavery did far more to tear
   families apart.

   MacBeath, the genealogist, says assembling Black family trees often
   leads to painful revelations. “Just yesterday, I came across a family
   that had been sold away in pieces,” she says. What’s more, the DNA of
   enslaved Black people and white slaveholders is closely intertwined.
   Such discoveries can be very emotional for descendants of both groups,
   says MacBeath. “Because what does that ultimately mean?” she says.
   “That somebody got raped. We have a lot of people who are just starting
   to realize this is what it is and they need to accept it, and that’s
   how they get a full family tree. And then there’s people who are still
   very traumatized by it and don’t want to talk about it.”

   Descendants of the Black Civil War hero Andrew Jackson Smith have
   always known they had a white slaveholder in their family, a Kentucky
   landowner named Elias P. Smith (also listed in some places as Elijah or
   Elisha Smith). In his last will and testament, Elias asked his son
   Harrison to care for two of the women he’d enslaved, Susan and
   Hilary—to “treat said Negroes differently from other slaves and keep
   them each comfortable and with all the necessaries of life as long as
   they shall live.” Susan was Andrew Jackson Smith’s mother, and it was
   common knowledge among both Black and white members of the family that
   Elias was Andrew’s father.

   When Elias’ white son William was serving in the Confederate Army, he
   planned on bringing his enslaved half-brother into battle with him. But
   Andrew managed to escape to the other side, joining a U.S. regiment. He
   fought in the Battle of Honey Hill, a failed attempt to block the
   Charleston and Savannah Railway. When Andrew Jackson Smith saw the U.S.
   color-bearer fall, he risked his life to take up the battle flags and
   carry them on through heavy enemy fire.

   In 1916, someone nominated Andrew Jackson Smith for a Medal of Honor.
   But the process stalled until his grandson, Andrew Bowman Sr., made it
   his mission to complete it. On January 16, 2001, President Bill Clinton
   invited Smith’s descendants to the White House, where he finally
   awarded Smith’s posthumous medal. “It was probably one of his last acts
   before he left office,” says Andrew Bowman Jr., who attended the
   ceremony with his father. He was moved that the president had taken the
   time to learn his ancestor’s story: “When he spoke about him, it was
   like he knew him.”

   Andrew Bowman Jr.’s 21-year-old son Kwesi is posing as Andrew Jackson
   Smith today. Kwesi was born after his family visited the White House,
   and he says it’s strange to be celebrated in this way. “I feel like a
   lot of Black Americans don’t really know what they are,” says Kwesi,
   who is a student at the University of Houston-Downtown. “I’m kind of
   jealous of people who do. I have friends who are Moroccan, Senegalese,
   Mexican—they’re all so proud of it. They’re representing, you know?”

   Kwesi pulls up the results of a recent genealogy test on his phone.
   About 80 percent of his genetic material comes from Africa: Nigeria,
   Cameroon, Benin, Togo, Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Most of his remaining
   DNA comes from Scandinavia and the British Isles. Andrew Jackson
   Smith’s white father is in there somewhere.

   As Kwesi talks, a longtime Civil War re-enactor named Calvin Osborne is
   busy sewing a patch onto his sleeve. Osborne got interested in Black
   Civil War history after seeing the movie Glory. He is part of the
   District of Columbia’s re-enactment group, Company B, and has been
   doing re-enactments for the past 30 years. In 2020, he found out that
   one of his own ancestors, William Lacy, fought in the war after
   escaping slavery as a young teenager.

   Osborne has supplied all the costumes and accessories for the
   Smithsonian photo shoot. The uniforms, crafted by a company in
   Mississippi, belong to Osborne’s fellow re-enactors. “This will be worn
   next week in Virginia,” Osborne says, adjusting Kwesi’s jacket. He
   points out the thickness of the wool. “If it’s cold you’ll be happy to
   have that coat on, but when it’s hot, not so much. They would march for
   about nine hours a day.”

   The 30 or so Black men in Osborne’s re-enactment group are on friendly
   terms with the white men who face off against them in mock battles.
   When asked what inspires the Confederate players to take part, Osborne
   says simply, “You’d have to ask them.” He adds, “Not all of the
   Confederate soldiers were slave owners. Some of them were fighting
   because somebody attacked their family. There’s lots of reasons people
   go to war, even today.”

   Osborne’s Black regiment generally has to surrender to the
   Confederates. “Oftentimes, Black regiments were given the toughest
   duty,” Osborne says. For instance, in the Battle of Fort Wagner in July
   1863, depicted in Glory, the U.S. Army sent the 54th Massachusetts
   Volunteer Infantry to breach a Confederate outpost guarding the
   Charleston Harbor. The Black men knew going into the fight that they’d
   suffer the heaviest casualties, while white soldiers would bring up the
   rear. Of the 650 Black men who took part in that battle, more than 270
   were killed, wounded, captured or presumed dead.

   Is it demoralizing for Osborne and his fellow re-enactors to play out
   scenes of fallen Black heroes over and over again? “It isn’t,” Osborne
   says. “Because we’re giving honor to them.”

   As the men mill around in their uniforms, Deanna Stanford Walz, a
   medical researcher, is getting her hair done. Her
   great-great-great-aunt Harriet Tubman almost certainly never spent
   hours at a salon, but Gardner wants Walz’s hair texture to resemble
   Tubman’s in a photograph from the late 1860s. Gardner also hired a
   costume designer from the Netflix show “The Crown” to recreate the
   blouse Tubman wore in the original picture.

   Tubman is famous for ferrying enslaved people to freedom, but she also
   played a crucial role in the Civil War. She slipped behind enemy lines
   and gathered information from enslaved people that could help the U.S.
   war effort, and on June 2, 1863, she put that intelligence to use. She
   led U.S. troops to the Combahee River in South Carolina, where they
   burned infrastructure and set fire to plantations. During the chaos,
   hundreds of enslaved laborers fled into the gunboats. Tubman said
   later, “They reminded me of the children of Israel coming out of
   Egypt.”

   laborer from Upstate New York, volunteered to join the 20th Colored
   Infantry the day after Christmas in 1863. Oliver survived the fighting
   in the South, but he died of malaria on the journey home and never saw
   the wife and two children he left behind again. Courtesy of the Miller
   Family Jared Miller Jared Miller is not the first member of his family
   to dress up as his ancestor Richard Oliver (left). His son once dressed

   glad to have both of these photos “to pass on to my children and my
   grandchildren, for them to see what we did for the country.” Drew

   Walz grew up in Auburn, New York, where Tubman lived out her later
   years. “We definitely spent more time talking about her than other
   school districts,” Walz says. “But I wasn’t really like, ‘Oooh, this is
   my heritage!,’ even though I did know at the time that I was related to
   her.” As an adult, Walz has a deeper appreciation for all the different
   things Tubman was able to do—she could navigate across different types
   of landscapes; she could work as a nurse or a cook; she could disguise
   herself as an old woman or as a man. “She did so much, and I guess I
   have that in me, too. It’s in my DNA.”

   Gardner says these kinds of reflections have made this one of the most
   meaningful photo shoots of his career. “There was a moment where I
   looked to the other end of the room and I saw all the descendants
   together,” he says later. “They were all asking, ‘Who were you related
   to?’ All these people were talking about their histories. It made me
   think about how much it would help society in the United States if more
   people could come together and have a better understanding of their
   shared history.”

   Before the Flowers family leaves for the day, Gardner tells them he’s
   invited a curator from the Massachusetts Historical Society, Mary E.
   Yacovone, to take the train down from Boston and tell them more about
   their ancestor. Yacovone knows a great deal about the 54th
   Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, a unit of Black men from throughout
   the United States. “There were big free populations of color but not
   enough to fill all the Massachusetts regiments,” Yacovone says. “So
   people just came from all over because they were so ready to serve.”

   She steps forward and holds out a gloved hand. “This is one of the most
   precious objects in our society’s collection,” she tells Neikoye and
   his parents. She holds out a small lapel pin that Moore had made for
   himself after the Civil War. There were no medals given to young men
   like Moore at the time, but private jewelers filled the gap and
   advertised custom-made mementos in newspapers. Yacovone points a
   careful finger toward the lapel pin. “It’s got his name and his
   regiment and the dates of the battles where he fought.” After the Civil
   War, Moore continued his military career. The 1870 U.S. census showed
   him serving with the 25th U.S. Infantry at Fort Clark in Texas.

   Neikoye and Judah put on white gloves so they can hold their ancestor’s
   memento and think about the pride he must have felt when he spent his
   own money to have it made. “They’re going to remember everything about
   this trip,” Janisse says, watching her 9-year-old twins. “And hopefully
   it turns that page in history where they can brag about this to their
   kids and grandkids.” When they do, they’ll have the pictures to go with
   it.

   Correction, December 15, 2023: An earlier version of this article
   incorrecly stated the U.S. regiment that Andrew Jackson Smith joined.
   While he worked as a servant to a major in the 41st Illinois Volunteer
   Infantry Regiment, he ultimately enlisted in the 55th Massachusetts
   Volunteer Infantry Regiment, with whom he fought in the Battle of Honey
   Hill. The article also misstated that it was Smith’s father who wanted
   to bring him into battle; in fact, it was his half-brother.
