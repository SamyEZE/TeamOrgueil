Father's "straight pride" flag lawsuit against Denver Public Schools could

   "Straight pride" flag lawsuit against DPS could succeed in court

   "Straight pride" flag lawsuit against DPS could succeed in court 02:25

   A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by one Denver Public Schools
   father alleging his two children have been denied their First Amendment
   rights to have a "straight pride" flag in school may stand a chance in
   court.

   "This is not a groundbreaking lawsuit. This is just a controversial
   lawsuit," said David Lane, a civil rights attorney based in Denver.

   CBS News Colorado has been following this lawsuit closely, which was
   first filed back on Nov. 10 by two Washington D.C. lawyers, Mike Yoder
   and ChadLaVeglia. The lawsuit argues Nathan Feldman, a father of two
   children attending the K-8 Slavens School in Denver, was denied being
   able to put up a cisgendered, heterosexual flag at school. He says a
   "straight pride" flag represents his children's beliefs and should be
   allowed on campus in the same way LGBTQ+ flags are allowed.

   have "straight pride flags" displayed in school

   A spokesperson for LGBTQ Colorado sent the following statement in
   response to the lawsuit:

   A Pride flag is not meant to be exclusive – it is designed to be
   inclusive. It is meant to draw attention and humanity to people who
   historically have been considered "illegal", ostracized, excluded, and
   for too long quiet victims of discrimination and violence.

   A Straight Pride Flag speaks "us vs them" wherein a Pride flag lifts up
   an "all of us" dynamic that recognizes the too often quiet and quieted
   LGBTQ+ community.

   This lawsuit has riled up a lot of discussion and concern on social
   media, especially among the Slavens School community. Slavens' parents
   created a change.org petition supporting the school's teachers and
   inclusivity and calling for Feldman to stop the lawsuit.

   "People are under the mistaken belief that offensive speech or hate
   speech is not protected speech. The U.S. Supreme Court has said the
   government doesn't get to choose and decide what is offensive, what is
   not offensive," said Lane. "If they're going to allow any political
   speech, they're going to have to allow all political speech of a
   related nature."

   Lane states DPS, a government-funded school, is required to allow this
   expression of speech.

   "As much as I may disagree politically with his position. I think First
   Amendment case law mandates that this school either eliminate LGBTQ
   flags and all flags of that nature or they allow him to fly whatever
   flag he wants," said Lane. "He is absolutely correct that this is a
   First Amendment violation.

   A district policy established back in January 2020,  supports the right
   of employees to post "rainbow flags or other signs of support for
   LGBTQIA+ students or staff."

   Lane, however, argues this policy cannot prohibit other forms of
   expression under the First Amendment.

   "A smart school district will either say, no we're not advertising
   political beliefs regarding sexual orientation in our schools," said
   Lane. "Or what's going to happen here is that if Denver loses this
   lawsuit, which they will, taxpayers are going to be on the hook for
   paying attorney's fees to these D.C. lawyers who filed the suit."

   As of today, a spokesperson for Denver Public Schools says they still
   have not been served with the lawsuit.

   Neither Feldman nor his attorneys have responded to multiple requests
   for comment.
