Is It Permissible to Have Pride? Is There Such Thing as Good Pride?

   [June 28, 2022] [Shaykh Yusuf Weltch]/in Adab, Living Religion,
   Spirituality
     __________________________________________________________________

   Answered by Shaykh Yusuf Weltch

Question

   What can we have pride in? Is there a good pride? I heard that we can
   have pride in battle as that gives us more strength or the feeling of
   strength, but my question is, does this mean any battle?

   If I was playing in a sports match could I have pride in myself? Also,
   is there a good type of pride?

Answer

   In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful and Compassionate

   Your question is another reflection of the difficulty and the downside
   of translation from Arabic to English. There are many words in the
   Arabic language that translate into words of similar meaning in
   English. One example of this is the words translated as pride.

   The word Kibr (translated as pride or arrogance) has a very bad
   connotation, whereas, the word Fakhr (translated as pride, also) can
   have a good connotation. Let’s define each as they are understood in
   the Arabic language.

Kibr

   Kibr (pride or arrogance) comes from the word Kabir, meaning to be
   great. Thus this word means the state of a person who deems themselves
   great in comparison to others. This is always a blameworthy
   characteristic for all created beings; this is because only Allah Most
   High is absolutely great: hence the saying Allahu Akbar. [Ghazali, Ihya
   ‘Ulum al-Din]

   To act out one’s pride (kibr), either inwardly or outwardly, is sinful.

Inward Manifestations of Pride

   The inward manifestation of pride is explained in the following
   Prophetic narration:

   The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and give him peace) said,
   “No one who has an atom’s weight of pride (kibr) in their heart will
   enter Paradise.” A man (amongst the Companions) said, “Surely a person
   loves that his clothes look good and that his shoes look good.” The
   Messenger replied, “Indeed, Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride
   (kibr) is to refuse to accept the truth and to look down on people.”
   [Muslim]

Outward Manifestations of Pride

   The outward manifestations of pride are many. Here are some of them:
     * Walking haughtily
     * Allowing their garments to drag on the floor, to show their status
     * Speaking harshly to people
     * Being upset when one is advised by others
     * Physical or emotional abuse of people
     * Backbiting [Ibid.]

   All of the above are prohibited in the Sacred Law. The only exception
   to some of the above is in the context of standing up against
   arrogant/oppressive people. The Great Yahya bin Muadh (Allah be pleased
   with him) said, “Showing pride in the face of a prideful person is
   humility.” i.e. it is warranted in some situations if done with the
   right intention.

   One of the situations that warrant this behavior is in battle. There
   are many examples of this in the various historical battles of Islam,
   in which the Believers are defending their lives, their freedom to
   worship Allah Most High alone, and the safety of the society. In such a
   situation, harshness is warranted.

   Even though a soccer match or a sports game may be competitive, it is
   not befitting for a Believer to be harsh, haughty, or act unjustly
   toward their opponents. Rather, the Believer, while striving to win,
   should uphold the greatest of character and dignity.

   Hope this helps
   Allah knows best

   ١٥٧٥ – وعن ابن مسعودٍ – رضي الله عنه – عن النبيّ – صلى الله عليه وسلم –
   قَالَ: «لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ
   مِنْ كِبْرٍ!» فَقَالَ رَجُلٌ: إنَّ الرَّجُلَ يُحِبُّ أَنْ يَكُونَ
   ثَوْبُهُ حَسَنًا، وَنَعْلُهُ حَسَنةً، فَقَالَ: «إنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ
   يُحِبُّ الجَمَالَ، الكِبْرُ: بَطَرُ الحَقِّ، وَغَمْطُ النَّاسِ». رواه
   مسلم. (١) ⦗٤٤٣⦘
