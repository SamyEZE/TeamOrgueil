     * Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've
       ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
       almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear
       of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the
       face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
       Steve Jobs
       Life, Fear, Failure
       Commencement Address at Stanford University, delivered 12 June
       2005, Palo Alto, CA

     * The reality is that everybody makes mistakes. The issue isn't
       whether you will make them, it's what you will do about them. It's
       whether you will choose the path of humility and courage or the
       path of ego and pride.
       Stephen Covey
       Motivational, Mistake, Humility
       Stephen M. R. Covey (2008). “The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that
       Changes Everything”, p.215, Simon and Schuster

     * It is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than
       to lose that someone you love with your useless pride.
       John Ruskin
       Pride, Someone You Love, Useless

     * You're going to make mistakes. The key is to learn from them as
       fast as possible and make changes as soon as you can. That's not
       always easy to do because ego and pride get in the way, but you
       have to put all that aside and look at the big picture.
       Tiger Woods
       Mistake, Pride, Keys

     * Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.

     * All peace-loving women shut up when they sense they have stepped
       onto Guy Turf. Guy Turf is a murky realm of ego and pride and
       chivalry and testosterone and heroism.
       Jeanne Marie Laskas
       Pride, Guy, Ego

     * Sitting with the poor and less fortunate people removes the ego and
       pride from your heart.

     * I tried to laugh early on about ego and pride... I do something
       great and then I do something really dumb and then I laugh. You'll
       always be that kid.

       Kids, Pride, Laughing

     * In Business School they taught us about cash flow, not about
       corporate politics; about return on equity, not about egos and
       pride. Oh, there were optional courses on 'Organizational Behavior'
       and 'Managerial Skills,' but these were a little too bloodless to
       convey what I learned on the job.
       Mary Cunningham Agee
       Leadership, Jobs, Business
       Mary Cunningham, Mary Cunningham Agee, Fran Schumer (1984).
