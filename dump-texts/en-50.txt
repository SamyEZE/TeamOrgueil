PRIDE Forum

   [PRIDE-Forum.jpg]

   The PRIDE (Plastic and Reconstruction Inclusion Driving Equity) Forum
   develops programming and resources to support LGBTQIA+ plastic surgeons
   and residents. The mission of the PRIDE Forum is to support a community
   of LGBTQIA+ physicians, medical students and allies who advance the
   field of plastic surgery through education, advocacy and partnerships.

   If you are attending Plastic Surgery The Meeting, be sure to join us at
   the PRIDE Reception on Saturday night!
