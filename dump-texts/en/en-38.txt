   “Feels like I’m about to open up a can of worms here but here it goes.”

   Those were the words from Quinte West resident Scott Hamilton during
   public input at the June 28 meeting of Quinte West City Council before
   criticizing the use of Pride flags in the community and ranting against
   the transgender community.

   After asking council about kids in his area not being able to take the
   school bus to Trenton High School, Hamilton then began to talk about
   the use of Pride flags.

   “These flags are everywhere and thrust into our faces everywhere we go,
   even on crosswalks,” Hamilton told council.

   Hamilton then told a story of explaining to his granddaughter what the
   pride flag meant and insisting he was not a homophobe before launching
   into a derogatory rant about the transgender community saying that
   “there is no such thing as transsexual people.”

   After continuing on about the transgender community, including the use
   of pronouns and transgender athletes in sports, Councillor Karen Sharpe
   interrupted the public input to inform Quinte West Mayor Jim Harrison
   that the allotted three minutes allowed to comment during public input
   had expired.

   Most of the presentations during delegations and public input had gone
   over their allotted time during the council meeting.

   Mayor Harrison said he would allow two more minutes.

   At that point, a member of the public, who was not identified,
   criticized Hamilton for the content of his speech and criticized
   council for allowing Hamilton to continue speaking.

   Hamilton told the man to walk out while another member of the audience
   could be seen showing the middle finger to the man and also telling him
   to leave.

   After continuing his speech, Mayor Harrison cut off Hamilton saying
   that he had made his point.

   Hamilton stated that he wanted to make a third point but was told by
   council that that would not be happening and that if he wanted to make
   that point, he could give public input at the next council meeting
   scheduled in July.

   Quinte West City Council had previously faced backlash in January after
   it had initially approved bringing the idea of changing the rainbow
   crosswalks to the Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Committee.

   Later that month at its next council meeting, members reaffirmed its
   commitment to keeping the rainbow crosswalks across the area.
