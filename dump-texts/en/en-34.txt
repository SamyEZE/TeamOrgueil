Subtle Signs of Pride in your Co-workers, Spouse, Family, Church Staff and
Everybody Else Around You

The Secretly Prideful Person
                           By Ronald McDonald
                           A friend told me the other day that I’m a very
                           prideful man, and I said to myself, "Dude's
                           just jealous". So I told my wife what he said
                           and she said, "Ah, come on. You're a humble
                           man. Seriously. You're not cocky and flashy and
                           arrogant and all that." But later that same
                           week, I was reading a book that said the most
                           prideful people aren’t usually the bragging
                           arrogant types. They’re the nice friendly
                           helpful ones at work.
                           That got me to thinking that maybe my
                           definition of pride wasn’t very complete. Now I
                           really wondered, What are examples of
                           pride? So, I googled “Signs of pride list” and
                           “Spiritual pride” and couldn’t believe what I
                           found. I was all over the list. I read about 40
                           articles and lists written by well-known
                           psychologists, theologians, pastors and even
                           the Wikipedia entry and consolidated them all
                           here. I put them into 4 groups; Pride of
                           Spirituality, Pride of Knowledge, Pride
                           of Power and Pride of Appearance. So I went
                           back to my wife and said, "Hey honey, I think I
                           found out the root of all of our problems in
                           marriage and work and ministry and all that.
                           ME!!! I'm the problem. Listen to this list of
                           signs of pride that I found." I started reading
                           my list to her and she laughed and said, "Wow!
                           You are prideful. I didn't know that's what
                           pride looked like." So I asked her to pray for
                           me. And then said, "Oh, and there were some
                           other signs that I found on the list." Her jaw
                           dropped as I read hers. She said, "Oh no! I
                           didn't realize I was so prideful either. Will
                           you pray for me too?"
                           God had been resisting me. It was like his palm
                           was firmly planted in my forehead as I walked
                           through life and it was really uncomfortable.
                           And it was constant. He doesn't bodyslam the
                           proud, he just resists them, but he gives grace
                           (free gifts that we didn't deserve or earn,
                           unmerited favor) to the humble. Could it be
                           that God is resisting you in your relationships
                           or business or church or whatever area of your
                           life? Only by pride comes contention.
                           There are about 24 different categories one
                           could be prideful in. Most people are pretty
                           humble in most categories and just prideful in
                           one or two. You’ll see your relatives, spouse,
                           boss, employees, friends and president all over
                           this list. But don't forget this. Pride is one
                           of the most destructive and heinous sins you
                           can commit.
                           My dad used to say, “The reason we shouldn’t
                           sin isn’t because the Bible says not to or
                           because it’s wrong or because we could get
                           caught or because it could mess up our future
                           or because we’ll miss out on blessings. No! We
                           should try not to sin because it hurts our
                           relationship with God.
                           Ever heard this? “Yeah, maybe I’ve got a little
                           pride. But if you want to get along with me
                           you’ve just got to grow a pair. It’s just the
                           way I am and you’ll just have to deal with it”.
                           For you to know you have even a little bit
                           of pride and not care about it, is to raise
                           your fist in God’s face and say, “Hey God, I
                           don’t care that I’m regularly walking and
                           living in this sin of pride and I’m okay with
                           not having all that great of a relationship
                           with you either”. If that’s you, then watch
                           out. God is resisting you and you have some
                           humiliation coming, which is the process of
                           becoming humble, because he loves you and those
                           around you so much. “God opposes, resists,
                           abhors, tears down, brings down. has scattered,
                           is scornful to, reprimands, will punish, is
                           angry at, every arrogant person, those who have
                           a proud look, those whose pride wells up,
                           arrogant scoffers. “The prideful man – ‬‭will
                           be brought low, humiliated, disgraced, doomed,
                           destroyed, humbled, will not go unpunished, was
                           deposed from his royal throne and his honor was
                           removed.” Prov 3:34,11:2, 16:5, 15:25, ‭29:23,
                           Ps. ‭18:27, 101:5, 119:21, Is.
                           2:11,12‬‭‬,10:12, 2 Chr. 32:25, Dan.‬ ‭5:20,
                           Luke 1:51, James 4:6. This is a really serious
                           thing.
                           We’ll never conquer pride, but if we know what
                           it looks like when it flares up, we can knock
                           it back down before too much damage is done. If
                           people can’t recognize what the signs of cancer
                           look like, then they'll never know they need
                           help. I hope this list helps you understand
                           what pride looks like as much as it's helped
                           me.

How They Define Pride
                           Our SELF or Ego is basically who we are as a
                           person. It’s not good or bad, it’s just what
                           makes us, us. Unhealthy pride happens when we
                           do or say things for the purpose of people
                           praising our SELF or for making our SELF feel
                           good or putting our SELF ahead of someone
                           else's SELF. Pride wants our SELF to be
                           praised, get glory, be worshiped and be highly
                           talked about, even when we’re not in the room.
                           Unhealthy pride can give us an elevated view of
                           our own SELF that is not accurate, but we truly
                           start to believe it and act to reinforce what
                           we've come to believe as true. And when someone
                           questions or challenges the view of our SELF as
                           not accurate, the fireworks begin.
                           Here are some of the definitions of pride I
                           found
                              - Pride is being SELF-ish
                              - Thinking excessively about SELF
                              - Pride’s base is too much SELF-love
                              - Thinking the worth of our SELF is higher
                                than it actually is
                              - SELF-worship
                              - Preoccupation with our image or SELF
                              - Pride is narcissism (in love with our
                                image or SELF)
                              - Pride is SELF-centered or EGO-centric
                                (everything revolves around us)
                              - Pride wants to keep the focus on SELF
                              - SELF-ness
                           "Satan disguises submission to himself under
                           the ruse of personal autonomy. He never asks us
                           to become his servants. Never once did the
                           serpent say to Eve, 'I want to be your Master'.
                           The shift in commitment is never from Christ to
                           evil; it is always from Christ to self. And
                           instead of his will, self-interest now rules
                           and what I want reigns. And that is the essence
                           of sin." - Dennis F. Kinlaw (1922 - 2017)
                           “Instead of being motivated by SELF-ish
                           ambition or vanity, each of you should, in
                           humility (THE OPPOSITE OF PRIDE OR SELF-ISH),
                           be moved to treat one another as more important
                           than your SELF. Each should be concerned not
                           only about your own interests, but about the
                           interests of others as well.” Philippians 2:3-4
                           “Jesus said to him, ‘Love the Lord your God
                           with all your heart, with all your soul and
                           with all your mind. This is the first and
                           greatest commandment. The second is like it:
                           Love your neighbor as you love your SELF. All
                           the law and the prophets depend on these two
                           commandments’ “Matthew 22:37-39
                           “Love is patient, love is kind, it is not
                           envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed
                           up. It is not rude, it is not SELF-serving, it
                           is not easily angered or resentful." (All
                           the negatives are symptoms of pride) I
                           Corinthians 13:4-5
                           The same list of examples of what pride looks
                           like, is here twice, one after the other. The
                           first list immediately below does not have much
                           explanation attached to the signs of pride.
                           Further down the page is the same list, but
                           with a much fuller explanation of each sign of
                           pride with some links to deeper
                           explanations. If you don’t agree, then google
                           “pride defensiveness” or "pride depression” or
                           “pride low self esteem” or “pride critical” to
                           learn why so many people consider it a sign of
                           pride. But be careful not to judge a person's
                           heart because of their actions or words. You
                           can't always tell. A friend of mine, who is a
                           huge servant and genuinely humble, told me that
                           when he serves others, he usually thinks to
                           himself, "I sure hope they feel cared for and
                           loved". But now and then he serves and says, "I
                           bet they think I'm quite the servant. I bet
                           they think I'm humble". Don't try to play God
                           and judge the heart.

Pride of Spirituality
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re spiritual
                           Asceticism - They reject money, pleasure, joy,
                           fame or possessions (They mistakenly think God
                           likes that)
                             1. Brag about how NOT materialistic they are
                             2. Excessively give away nice possessions or
                                money that God gives them
                             3. Tell everyone, “I gave up a high paying
                                career to do this ministry”
                             4. Make excuses for the physical blessings in
                                their life
                             5. Look down their SELF righteous noses at
                                the wealthy or successful
                           Super Christians
                             1. Spiritualize every conversation
                             2. Speak with a different accent or voice
                                about spiritual stuff
                             3. Think they’re more spiritual or righteous
                                than others around them
                             4. Feel morally superior
                             5. Despise and detest sinners
                             6. Insist on having certain roles in the
                                church that they're disqualified or not
                                qualified for, just to prove to people
                                that they're spiritual
                             7. Talk a lot about their spiritual
                                gift of apostle or prophet, but not about
                                the less public ones
                             8. Talk about how much they pray
                             9. Look down on or badmouth Christians or
                                other denominations who believe
                                differently than they do about spiritual
                                gifts
                            10. Talk about their fasting SO THAT people
                                know they're fasting “When you fast, do
                                not look sullen like the hypocrites, for
                                they make their faces unattractive SO
                                THAT people will see them fasting. I tell
                                you the truth, they have their
                                reward.”Matthew 6:16
                           Prayer isn’t from the heart  “Whenever you
                           pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because
                           they love to pray while standing in synagogues
                           and on street corners SO THAT people can see
                           them. Truly I say to you, they have their
                           reward.” Matthew 6:5
                             1. Rehearse or spruce up their public
                                prayers using different words and
                                phrases that they would never say when
                                praying alone
                             2. Talk to the people when they say they are
                                praying to God. ie. Give mini-sermonettes,
                                remind the audience of the week's
                                schedule, etc.
                             3. Say, "I'll pray for that" when they
                                absolutely have no intention of praying
                                for it. But it sounds spiritual for sure.
                           False Humility - Humility is seeing yourself
                           and what you do the way it actually is. Pride
                           is not seeing yourself or what you do the way
                           it actually is.
                             1. Don’t accept compliments, but instead say,
                                "Thank you but no. It was all God" (If it
                                were all God, it would have been WAY
                                better than you did it)
                             2. Say that they’re lower and worse than
                                everyone else
                             3. Tell you that they’re humble, “In my
                                humble opinion”

Pride of Knowledge
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re smart
                           Unteachable
                             1. Get irritated if someone tries to teach
                                them something

                                what you're going to say. You were going

                           ever get defensive in marriage, then you have
                           pride and it has to be dealt with. We think the
                           best defense is a great offense when our pride
                           is hurt. “With pride comes only
                           contention...”Proverbs‬ ‭13:10

                                them)

                             1. Don’t discuss differences to learn, just
                                to show off how much they know
                             2. "Told you so". Remind you about when they
                                were right and you were wrong

                           they’re capable. “But once he became powerful,
                           his pride destroyed him. He disobeyed the LORD
                           his God...” ‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭26:16‬
                           Controlling - Being obeyed gives their SELF a
                           nice feeling, sense of power

                                children close
                             4. Try to control or sway their adult
                                children’s marriages
                             5. Use women and keep them hanging on

                                boycott events, scream, threaten divorce,

                           Legalistic - Control through excessive rules -
                           their SELF feels really nice when they
                           are obeyed
                             1. Don’t want kids to rebel mostly so that
                                the parent’s SELF or Image isn’t

                                in strict dress codes and grooming

                                can read (huge red flag)

                                and absolutely no work on Sundays (except
                                for pastors and church staff, of course)
                           Won’t submit - It makes their SELF falsely
                           feel inferior if they have a positional
                           leader, though it has nothing to do with
                           wisdom, knowledge or ability.
                             1. Want the autonomy to decide how to live
                                their life, so won’t submit or surrender
                                to God. “God opposes the proud, but he
                                gives grace to the humble. So submit to
                                God. But resist the devil and he will flee
                                from you. Draw near to God and he will
                                draw near to you.” James‬ ‭4:5-8

                           guidance, help or wisdom from God or man. “When
                           they were fed, they became satisfied; when they
                           were satisfied, they became proud; as a result,
                           they forgot me!”Hosea‬ ‭13:6‬

                                ministry, in a humble sounding way
                             3. Hint around at their success
                             4. Claim that they're a genius or one of the
                                best ever or one of the best on their team
                             5. Talk a lot about their importance, status,
                                accomplishments, possessions, education,
                                title, position, credentials or financial
                                status
                             6. Name drop the high-status people they
                                associate with
                             7. Surround themselves with good looking or
                                successful people
                             8. Think certain tasks would lower their
                                image or value of their SELF
                             9. Think they’re above certain tasks
                            10. Feel entitled to high treatment
                            11. Feel superior to or are prejudiced
                                towards less wealthy, refined, educated
                                or less successful people or those from a
                                different country or culture
                           Inconvenience others - the world revolves
                           around their SELF. Self-centered, ego-centric,
                           self-absorbed
                             1. Feel powerful when people have to wait on
                                them. I often wonder if people who drive
                                slow in the fast lane and won't let people
                                pass are just jerks or just ignorant
                             2. Regularly make everyone wait on them to
                                get to the meeting so they can start
                             3. Inconsiderate. Don’t consider other
                                people’s time
                           Not interested in other people
                             1. Rarely ask questions of others because
                                they’re more interested in their SELF than
                                in the SELF of others
                             2. Dominate conversations talking about
                                their SELF thinking or how much they know
                                SO THAT we're impressed with their SELF
                             3. Rarely compliment people
                             4. Wait to be served instead of serve
                             5. Neglect others
                             6. Not generous
                             7. Abandon their family to pursue their own
                                SELF feeling good
                           Low SELF-esteem or SELF-worth - Humility is
                           seeing your own SELF the way it actually is.
                           Pride is not seeing your own SELF the way it
                           actually is
                             1. Constantly thinking of their SELF and what
                                others think about it
                             2. Feel inferior
                             3. Think they’re not worthy of a good spouse
                                or job
                             4. Constantly dating abusive people
                             5. SELF-loathing
                             6. Believe that people don’t like them
                             7. Avoid successful or attractive people
                             8. Put their SELF down so that others affirm
                                and build them up
                             9. Often say that they’re ugly
                            10. Make excuses for their nationality “but
                                I’m of European descent”
                            11. Self-conscious for lack of education,
                                beauty, social or economic status
                            12. Don’t share their shortcomings or needs
                           Depression - There are a lot of legitimate
                           medical and traumatic reasons for depression.
                           Focus on SELF and believing what’s not true
                           about their SELF is a very common one. Pride is
                           a major cause of depression for hundreds of
                           millions of people (much more about why this is
                           here, on the second list)
                           Shyness - this isn’t about introvert or
                           extrovert
                             1. Overly concerned with others opinions of
                                their SELF
                             2. Social isolation
                             3. Are afraid of not being liked
                             4. Are afraid of being criticized
                             5. Are afraid of being rejected again
                             6. Are afraid of embarrassing themselves
                           Highly Sensitive
                             1. Read into innocent remarks as demeaning,
                                threatening or critical
                             2. Can’t laugh at themselves when they do
                                something funny
                             3. Can’t accept good natured teasing
                             4. Have a hard time forgiving
                             5. Are offended when their idea, ability or
                                motive is questioned
                             6. Quick to be angry
                           Envious - think that when others have things
                           they don’t, it makes their SELF look bad. “For
                           where there is jealousy and SELF-ishness, there
                           is disorder and every evil practice...”
                           ‭‭James‬ ‭3:16-17‬
                             1. Constantly compare themselves to others
                             2. Bothered when someone equal to them has
                                success
                             3. Wants other people’s status symbols to
                                make their SELF look better
                             4. Sabotage those close to them so good
                                things or success won’t happen
                             5. Believe other people are envious of them

Pride of Appearance
                           Try really hard to impress people with their
                           looks or physique - Synonyms - Narcissistic,
                           SELF-love, Conceited, SELF-glorification,
                           Egotistic, SELF-worship. “Your heart was proud
                           because of your beauty; you corrupted your
                           wisdom on account of your splendor...”
                           ‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭28:17  Though it is important that
                           we do the best with the hand we were dealt,
                           especially for our spouse.
                             1. Feel their appearance gives their SELF
                                more worth
                             2. Think their beauty makes their SELF
                                superior to others
                             3. Flaunt their figure/physique so others
                                will praise them
                             4. Spend excessive time on hair, clothing,
                                weight, body shape to impress
                             5. Anorexia or bulimia
                             6. Work hard to avoid the appearance of aging
                             7. Often post photos or videos of themselves
                                exercising
                             8. Spend excessive time for their SELF to
                                look good while neglecting family
                           Two things to remember:
                           1. Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just
                           reporting the facts, ma'am. These signs of
                           pride are what I found and copied down and
                           then consolidated here for your reading
                           pleasure. Most were on several of the lists.
                           2. If you only saw your SELF in a couple of
                           places on this list, then you just have a
                           little bit of cancer. You need to be desperate
                           for treatment. Everyone is infected with Pride.
                           Don't be okay with it. This is serious.
                            “But then Hezekiah and the residents of
                           Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned
                           their pride, and the LORD was not angry with
                           them for the rest of Hezekiah’s reign." ‭‭2
                           Chronicles‬ ‭32:26
                           “if my people who are called by my name humble
                           themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn
                           from their wicked ways, then I will hear from
                           heaven and will forgive their sin and heal
                           their land. NOW my eyes will be open and my
                           ears attentive to the prayer that is made in
                           this place.” 2 Chronicles‬ ‭7:14-15‬
                           “Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will
                           exalt you.” ‭‭James‬ ‭4:5
                           “But one who is humble, has a lowly spirit,
                           will gain honor, wisdom, be exalted, shown
                           favor, be listened to, receive grace” (free
                           gifts that we don’t deserve or earn. Unmerited
                           favor)‭ Proverbs‬ ‭3:34, 29:23‬, ‭11:2‬, James
                           4:5, 10, 2 Chronicles‬ ‭7:14

Don’t Miss This. Super Important
                           “The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit
                           - O God, a humble and repentant heart you will
                           not reject.” Psalm 51:17
                           God is not after your perfect behavior. He is
                           after a humble spirit and a contrite heart. I
                           looked up what the word “contrite” meant and it
                           said, “repentant or remorseful”. When my wife
                           and I read the list and saw ourselves on it in
                           some places, we immediately pleaded with God to
                           help us keep our pride down and be more humble.
                           We don’t want it at all and we are really sorry
                           that we have been so prideful for so long. And
                           now we question ourselves all the time, “Is
                           what I’m about to say or what I just said,
                           prideful? Because we really don’t want to be
                           prideful, even though we still act pridefully.
                           But a lot less. This is exactly what God wants
                           from us. A humble spirit and a contrite heart.
                           "For thus says the High and Lofty One Who
                           inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell
                           in the high and holy place, with him who has a
                           contrite and humble spirit, To revive the
                           spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart
                           of the contrite ones.'" – Isaiah 57:15

Three Pride Illustrations

Fighter in the Ring
                           We are in a fight with Prideman, a 600 lb 1%
                           body fat former Navy Seal, who has us by
                           the ankles slamming us down over and over
                           again. It’s a tag team match and God is
                           reaching his hand in there for us to tag so he
                           can fight for us, but he won’t tag us. But we
                           keep on saying, “No, I’m alright God. I’ve got
                           this, but would you mind helping me by
                           squirting some water in my mouth next time
                           around?” as Prideman keeps slamming us over and
                           over again. There may be 21 of the pride
                           categories where we don’t struggle, but one
                           area where we do. I encourage you to be
                           Humbleman and tag God’s hand to wage war for
                           you in that category. “God, I’m ready for you
                           to fight Prideman instead of me. I can’t do it.
                           You need to take over completely.” That’s what
                           humble people say.
                           My SELF says, “No, I can handle this! I just
                           won’t be this way anymore! I’ll turn over a new
                           leaf!” This always fails. Only God can change
                           how I am … and He really, really wants to.
                           "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy
                           laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke
                           upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle
                           and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for
                           your souls." – Matt. 11:28-29
                           "Therefore humble yourselves under
                           the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you
                           in due time…" 1 Pet. 5:6

Pride Monster
                           Imagine you’re in a canoe and there is a big
                           pride sea-monster that never stops chasing you
                           and it wants to eat you and it’s coming up and
                           down in the water chasing right behind you. So
                           you paddle like crazy to not get bit. Imagine
                           you paddle super hard for a long time and you
                           get really far ahead of it and so you put down
                           your paddle and kick up your feet and take a
                           break. And that’s when the pride monster
                           catches up to you and bites you hard.

Two Dogs
                           Two hungry dogs and only one dish of food. The
                           dog who eats the most is the one who gets
                           stronger and wins the fight. Pridedog is more
                           aggressive and pushier than Humbledog and so
                           pushes Humbledog out of the way and eats all of
                           the food unless someone purposefully pulls back
                           on Pridedog’s chain. That is when Humbledog
                           eats all of the food and wins. Here are some
                           things you can do to feed Humbledog.
                              - Be thankful everyday by telling God 20
                                things you’re thankful for
                              - Compliment little things you like about
                                others around you
                              - Learn about others. Practice asking
                                people 5 questions. Maybe these. What’s
                                your name? How long have you lived here?
                                Why did you move here? What do you do? How
                                did you get interested in that?
                              - Share your pride struggles with people
                                close to you and ask them to pray for you
                                and to tell you when they see your signs
                                of pride.

How Extreme Pride Slips In
                           Particularly for public figures like pastors,
                           CEO’s, singers, athletes, actors and actresses,
                           pride slips in subtly and undetected. And after
                           several years of being innocently complimented
                           and praised, we start believing things about
                           our SELF (ego) that are over-inflated above
                           what is actually true. And that view of our
                           SELF begins to feel actual and normal. And then
                           we say and do things so that others think as
                           highly about us as we do. And we do that
                           because we deeply believe that how highly we
                           think about our SELF is accurate and true. We
                           start thinking more about our own SELF than the
                           SELFs of others around us. Did you know that
                           the career with the highest rate of adultery is
                           a pastor.

How Humility Happens to Hard People
                           They say that pride is the last thing to leave
                           before a lot of people come to Christ. They’re
                           tired of trying to fight it on their own and
                           when they’ve tried everything else and have
                           been humbled, then they turn to God. They say,
                           “God, I’ve got a problem with pride and I’m
                           asking that YOU wage war on it. I’ll stand
                           aside. Please fight it for me.” Until a person
                           gets to that point and is serious, Life’s not
                           going to be easy. It usually takes losing a
                           spouse, the kids, a job or a few nights in the
                           car before someone raises their hand and says,
                           “Hi, my name is Ronald McDonald and I’m a
                           pride-a-holic and I need help.”
                           Self-Centered Churches and Man Boobs
                           I was listening to a non faith based marriage
                           book the other day and the author said that
                           Narcissism and Grandiosity (both forms of
                           pride) are a huge problem in America. A lot of
                           it started in the early 1970’s when personal
                           trainers and tons of self help books became
                           super common.  “You can do it. You’ve got what
                           it takes. You are worth it. There are no
                           losers. We don’t keep score. We don’t give
                           grades. Everybody wins and everybody passes.”
                           We clearly live in a self-centered (prideful)
                           society. So how wouldn’t that not bleed into
                           the church? Most churches rightly have the
                           slogan “To know God and make him known”, but
                           rarely do sermons magnify God. In other words,
                           make God look bigger and clearer so we know him
                           better. In my experience, there are more
                           self-help type sermons about how to become a
                           better Christian than there are about what God
                           is like. Most songs are about us worshiping
                           rather than about God being worshipped and
                           stats say that only 2% of people have ever led
                           someone to faith in Christ. Evangelism is a
                           rare thing because not many are concerned about
                           the SELF of others more than they are their own
                           SELF. (More about this paragraph later.)
                           So if God is not very much the focus of our
                           teachings nor our worship, then it makes sense
                           that 85% of youth who grow up in church, stop
                           going to church when they leave home. Because
                           they don’t know very well what God is like,
                           they don’t really like him that much. If they
                           knew the God that I know, they would want 10 of
                           him in their lives.
                           Essential Oils and Man Boobs
                           I recently read a study to my family that said
                           Lavender and Tea Tree Oil probably cause man
                           boobs to grow on prepubescent boys. My 10 year
                           old son’s eyes got as big as saucers and we all
                           started to laugh because we have Tea Tree and
                           Lavender shampoo and conditioner out in the
                           shower. He immediately stopped using it just in
                           case the study were true.
                           So the question came up, since my wife is so
                           into essential oils, why would anyone use those
                           oils on prepubescent boys when there are
                           hundreds of other scents that smell similar or
                           do the same thing (if they even do anything)?
                           Is the reward of what Tea Tree and Lavender
                           give you worth the risk of man boobs? Why do
                           anything even closely similar. And if a study
                           said there were an essential oil that
                           eventually would give you the strength and
                           stamina and the heart of a stallion if you rub
                           a drop on your chest once a week, you can bet
                           I’d be slathering it on there every few days.
                           If you knew for sure that it couldn’t hurt? Why
                           wouldn’t you? But if it could possibly be the
                           wrong thing to do, why even try it?
                           You can’t go wrong having a church that is
                           focused on knowing and magnifying God each and
                           every week in sermons and song, but you could
                           go wrong focusing on our SELF most of the time
                           and God sometimes.
                           I was talking with a worship leader from Canada
                           and he agreed. He said we live in a society
                           plagued with individualism. He said that if we
                           went back in time a hundred years ago, people
                           would think we were crazy and self-centered if
                           we lived like we do now. But it’s become
                           normal.
                           Self-Help Churches
                           So many churches have turned into Self Help
                           Churches. “We won’t talk about your sin here
                           because that would be telling you that you’re
                           wrong or not in a good state. Instead, here are
                           all of the things you can get out of God for
                           your SELF if you accept Christ. You’ll be
                           happier. You can go to Heaven. You can have an
                           abundant life. You can be powerful, but I’m not
                           saying that you’re not already powerful and
                           really important, but you could be even more so
                           if you give your life to Christ. You can be
                           healthy. You can be wealthy. You can get peace,
                           even in storms. And joy too. You can have a
                           healthy community. Today can be the first day
                           of the rest of your life. “I’ll see you at the
                           top”. These are all good things you’ll learn in
                           your Bible reading and in Bible study.
                           Heaven forbid we offend someone by telling them
                           that they’re on the wrong team and in need of
                           someone to save them from having to pay the
                           penalty of their sin because they aren’t
                           capable to do it by themselves. You would now
                           be considered a toxic person.
                           And then, once they’re on the team, they hear,
                           “Here’s how YOU can be a better Christian. How
                           YOU can forgive more. How YOU can be kinder.
                           Here’s how YOU can be more servantlike. How YOU
                           can be more loving. How YOU can be more
                           Christlike. Here’s how YOU can be more
                           merciful. Here’s how YOU can be more filled
                           with grace.” Here’s how you can have more
                           faith. Here’s how you can get more power. Here
                           are 5 steps to getting more out of the Holy
                           Spirit. POWER. P - plead O - optimism W - weep
                           E - earn it R - reward.
                           Self-Centered Songs
                           Note here: This seems logical to me, but I’m
                           still not exactly sure what to think about
                           this.
                           Here are definitions of Praise and Worship from
                           the dictionary.
                           Praise - To express warm approval or admiration
                           of (usually for an act).
                           Worship - The feeling or expression of
                           reverence and adoration for a deity.
                           If there were a music video of the “Praise and
                           Worship” song we’re singing on Sunday morning,
                           who would the camera be focused on most? Would
                           it be focused on me on a mountaintop with my
                           hands raised to Heaven as I talked about how I
                           was singing to Him and how I can’t stop singing
                           and how I raise my voice to do it and how
                           nobody can stop me from singing? Would it be me
                           looking into a mirror admitting that I am not
                           worthy of Him? Me on my knees praying to God
                           asking for strength and courage and endurance
                           and more of his power and love in me? Or would
                           it be focused on our all wise and patient God
                           who is kind in all of his works and on our
                           loving and compassionate Jesus on the cross and
                           about how powerful of a creator he is. Or Is
                           God sitting on his throne tapping his fingers
                           saying to himself, “I wonder when I get a
                           song”?
                           I analyzed the top 40 most sung songs in
                           churches according to CCLI and highlighted the
                           parts that magnified or talked about God’s
                           attributes or character in some way. This is
                           what I found.
                           9 songs - almost 100% focused on God.
                           10 songs - 50% of the words were about God and
                           50% about the worshiper.
                           12 songs - 25% of words were about God and 75%
                           focused on the worshiper.
                           9 songs - mentioned God with only 3 to 8 words
                           and focused on the worshiper with the rest.
                           There may be a place for a warm up song or two.
                           A prayerful song. A song to get us into the
                           right posture for Worshipping and Praising
                           God.  I’m not sure. But remember this, just
                           because it’s on the radio doesn’t mean it’s a
                           worship song. Because it’s a Psalm, doesn’t
                           mean that is a worship song. Imagine singing
                           “Break the teeth of my enemies, oh God” in
                           church. It’s just a nice song that God inspired
                           them to write to build up and encourage
                           believers. We can worship in a lot of ways,
                           like in giving money, working hard etc.
                           Sometimes, even a secular song will get me
                           focused on God and I’ll worship Him in that.
                           But like the essential oils, if there are so
                           many hundreds of songs that magnify and praise
                           God, why not pick one of those instead of the
                           warm up songs? There is no way we could go
                           wrong singing songs about all of the things
                           that we love about God. But WHAT IF God
                           considers our ME songs as self-centered? What
                           if he does tap his fingers while we sing to
                           ourselves?

Pride of Spirituality

Appearing Really Spiritual
                           People should be spiritually minded. God loves
                           that. It’s the way we’re supposed to be. But
                           when we want everybody to recognize and talk
                           about and praise us for how spiritually minded
                           we are, that’s not good. So we say and do
                           things for the purpose of reinforcing that
                           we’re spiritual, in their minds. The only
                           people Jesús was publicly against were those
                           who did and said things so that people would
                           think they were spiritual. The Pharisees prayed
                           fancy prayers, made it obvious they were
                           fasting, let everyone know when they tithed
                           etc. so that their image (SELF or ego) would be
                           raised up in the eyes of everyone around them.
                           And then praised for being so spiritual.

Rejection of Material Possessions
                           Rejection of Material Possessions Sometimes
                           with good intentions, people think that God is
                           pleased when we don’t have things of value.
                           Righteous living. And then in their pride can
                           say, “If only those materialistic people were
                           as righteous as I”.
                              - Reject money, fame, joy or pleasure (also
                                called Asceticism) monks (vows of
                                poverty), clergy, pastors, theologically
                                trained and missionaries are infamous for
                                this, while humble people accept God’s
                                blessings as a reward from Him. “I gave up
                                a really high paying corporate job to do
                                this ministry”.
                              - Brag about how few possessions they have
                                or how humbly they live so that people
                                will recognize they are not materialistic
                                and therefore very spiritual.
                              - Embarrassed or make excuses about owning
                                nice things or big houses.
                              - Look down their noses at the rich or at
                                those who have a lot of nice things
                              - Excessively generous partially out of
                                obedience to what God has put on their
                                hearts to do and partially for the purpose
                                of confirming in people’s minds that they
                                aren’t eating mammon for breakfast and are
                                still spiritually minded. They reject
                                God’s rewards or gifts to them and think
                                that that shows their commitment to God.
                                “Dang, that guy sure is committed to God.
                                I don’t think I could do or live like
                                that.”

Churchy Language and Prayers

Spiritualize everything
                              - They only talk about spiritual things so
                                that people will think they’re spiritual.
                              - Prideful people spruce up their public
                                prayers with churchy vocabulary or higher
                                volume that they never use when talking to
                                God alone, to make sure people recognize
                                that they’re spiritual. We’re not talking
                                about people who pray and are passionate
                                and their heart and personality come out
                                while praying. Be careful not to judge
                                one’s heart. But if prayers are changed so
                                that those listening are impressed with us
                                and think, “That guy is a real spiritual
                                man. He sure can pray”, then that’s always
                                pride.
                              - Practice their public prayers
                              - Prideful people often speak differently,
                                use a different accent or voice or put on
                                a different face or behavior to help
                                people recognize that they’re spiritual.
                                Walking and pacing and flailing the arms
                                is not wrong if it’s for presentation or
                                for a purpose. Again, be careful not to
                                think you can judge the thoughts and
                                intents of someone else’s heart. Only God
                                can do that.
                              - They think they’re more spiritual than
                                spouses and church members.

False Humility
                           Prideful people fake their humility. They try
                           extra hard to be humble for the purpose of
                           people thinking that they’re humble so they’ll
                           be praised for being so humble. A very humble
                           friend of mine, who serves everybody ahead of
                           himself, confessed to me that every once in a
                           while he does something really selfless and
                           servant-like and walks away saying to himself,
                           “I bet they think I’m pretty humble”. That’s
                           not True Humility. It’s called False Humility.
                           It’s just a matter of the heart.
                              - Prideful put themselves down as if they
                                are lower than everybody else. This may
                                even flow from a genuine desire for
                                humility, but humility is seeing your SELF
                                the way you accurately are. Pride is
                                seeing your SELF NOT the way you actually
                                are.
                              - Treat themselves badly - “I am not worthy”
                                or “I’m a loser”.
                              - Prideful people don’t easily accept
                                compliments. They put one hand in front of
                                you like they’re stopping traffic and with
                                the other they point to the heavens while
                                vigorously shaking their head and mouthing
                                the words, “No no no - God, God”. If
                                someone says that to you, you can say to
                                them, “That really seemed like it was all
                                you. If it had been God, then it would
                                have been WAY better than that”. Their
                                pride wants those watching to say, “Whoa,
                                that guy is humble. He must be really
                                spiritual”. The right response would be to
                                say something that is actually true,
                                “Thank you. That was very kind of you to
                                say. God has given everybody gifts and I
                                believe this is what he gave me”. Or,
                                “It’s easy to do good work when God
                                surrounds me with some great people.” or
                                “Thank you for the kind words. Mom and Dad
                                made me take lessons for years and
                                years.”
                              - Prideful people skillfully brag in a
                                humble way. “Can you believe how great God
                                is. They asked me to speak at the Prayer
                                Breakfast again.” or “Please pray for my
                                church. We don’t know how to handle all of
                                the growth.” They brag about their work,
                                accomplishments, ministry, earnings etc.
                                because if they just flat out bragged
                                about their SELF, they wouldn’t look too
                                spiritual.
                              - Prideful people tell you they’re humble
                                and say, “In my humble opinion”.
                              - Only confess insignificant sins - Prideful
                                people confess little sins and say things
                                like, “I really struggle with coveting my
                                neighbor’s old Toyota Land Cruiser
                                everytime I drive by their house.” As if
                                that’s as bad as their sin gets, so you
                                think they’re spiritual.
                              - They take a lot of pleasure in
                                SELF-rightness feelings of being morally
                                superior to most other Christians, which
                                makes them feel better about their own
                                failings.

Pride of Knowledge
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re smart
                           “The wise person accepts instructions, but the
                           one who speaks foolishness will come to ruin.”

Unteachable
                           I asked a friend of mine, who wanted to start a
                           church, if he had considered formally studying
                           the Bible. He looked at me and asked, “But what
                           could I learn?” He felt he knew everything
                           already.
                              - Prideful people say they don’t need to be
                                trained or educated because that would
                                mean their SELF wasn’t capable enough to
                                be successful without someone’s help.
                                Prideful people want to say, “I became a
                                successful and accomplished self-made man
                                by myself. I didn’t need anyone to teach
                                me anything because I’m that smart or
                                capable. I’m sure you’re impressed with
                                me”.
                              - Prideful people think they have all the
                                answers to life and somehow don’t need or
                                see the value in other people’s
                                perspectives.
                              - They are know-it-all’s and say, “I already
                                knew that”.
                              - They are highly opinionated and
                                argumentative.
                              - Use big words knowing that they will
                                probably have to explain what they mean.
                              - Irritated if someone tries to teach them
                                something because that makes their SELF
                                feels ignorant.

Not Genuinely Interested in Other People
                              - They don’t ask questions to learn about
                                people because they aren’t interested in
                                other people more than they’re interested
                                in their own SELF. So why would they want
                                to know how many kids a person has, if
                                their parents are still alive, what parts
                                of work they enjoy or their favorite past
                                times?
                              - Dominate conversations with talk of
                                themselves or about the subject at hand to
                                impress you so you think they’re smart.
                              - Though credentials and titles are
                                sometimes necessary to establish authority
                                so they’ll listen to or negotiate with
                                you, prideful people insist on a lofty
                                title or talk a lot about their
                                credentials so that others will be more
                                impressed and think more highly of them.

Poor Listeners
                              - Interrupt people mid-sentence. I once knew
                                a con-man who used to regularly interrupt
                                me and say, “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to
                                interrupt but…” And he conned me.
                              - Hear out people’s ideas and nod their
                                head, with no intention of using their
                                idea.
                              - Finish others’ sentences or say, “I know
                                what you’re going to say. You’re going to
                                say….”
                              - Open their mouth kind of and make slight
                                noises with their lips and act like
                                they’re going to start talking so you stop
                                talking so they can start. If you pause
                                mid-thought to take a breath, they start
                                talking.
                              - Assume they know all there is about the
                                subject and so tune out
                              - Don’t listen to those they lead
                              - Prideful people listen to others just to
                                see if they can fix them or bless and
                                impress them with their wisdom and
                                knowledge.

Argumentative
                           Prideful people argue strange, new or
                           uncommonly held beliefs or doctrines and argue
                           them well so that people are impressed with
                           their intellect.
                              - They get the last word
                              - Prideful people don’t discuss their
                                differences with the hope of possibly
                                learning something. They argue to show how
                                much they know.
                              - Prideful people don’t hesitate confronting
                                someone to say what they think is right.
                              - They can’t handle being wrong.
                              - Argue and hold to strange or uncommonly
                                held beliefs. To show that they can argue
                                and should be respected for their ability
                                to argue. Flat Earth, The Millenium has
                                already past. Moon landing was fake. Note:
                                There are exceptions though. Like I
                                genuinely believe in Bigfoot. There’s just
                                too much evidence. And I once saw Nessie’s
                                shadow in Loch Ness from way up high, but
                                my wife doesn’t believe me.

Critical
                           Helpful or constructive criticism is used by
                           God in our lives to build us up and make us
                           more fruitful. And a lot of people can be
                           critical only because they want to help us
                           improve. The key is how we deliver that
                           criticism and that we do it sparingly. We need
                           to ask ourselves, “Would it make a difference
                           if I critique this?” If it won’t, then just let
                           it go. A good practice is to ask permission to
                           give the criticism, “Would you like a thought
                           about how to make that even better?”
                           Unnecessary criticism is just mean. It tears
                           down, doesn’t help and makes people feel bad.
                           It is usually based in poor self-worth and
                           shame. Prideful people measure themselves
                           against others. When someone near them does a
                           good thing, it makes their SELF feel inferior,
                           and so they tear them down for no reason other
                           than to make their SELF feel better. When we
                           put the spotlight on other’s flaws, that’s a
                           defense that puts the shortcomings of our SELF
                           in the shadows.
                              - Quick to correct or criticize their
                                spouse, kids, pastor, teacher, youth
                                pastor or others in leadership positions.
                              - Negative all the time. Complain a lot
                                about the weather, their health,
                                circumstances, job, church.
                              - Tear others down by joking or teasing
                                harshly
                              - Always give the punishment deserved
                                instead of showing mercy

Pride of Power
                           Thinking that they’re more important than
                           others or trying to make sure people think
                           they’re capable.

Pride and a Controlling Nature
                           Here is a comprehensive article full of
                           psychobabble about why the need to control,
                           feel superior and be mean to others is such a
                           huge sign of
                           pride.http://mindrenewal.us/page6.html

Control
                           Control is trying to give yourself security.
                           But remember, you are one cancer cell away from
                           being in control.
                              - Prideful people control their spouse,
                                children, friends and co-workers.
                              - Prideful parents create dependent children
                                by providing everything for them and not
                                letting them suffer the consequences of
                                their irresponsible actions. They want to
                                keep them around to be needed. A form of
                                control.
                              - Prideful people manipulate to get their
                                way by throwing their wedding ring across
                                the room or throw some sort of tantrum
                                whether it’s really quiet or really loud.
                                They try to condition you to go with their
                                idea everytime.
                              - Prideful people say it’s my way or no way.
                                They threaten to boycott the trip or
                                activity by saying, “Nevermind, I don’t
                                even want to go now” if they don’t get
                                their way.
                              - They purposefully drive slow in the fast
                                lane so they have control, not considering
                                that the person behind them who may have
                                an urgent matter.

Legalistic
                           Legalism is when a really religious sounding
                           person or people crave for their SELF to be
                           respected and praised through power and
                           control. They force their own questionable or
                           easily debatable standards and rules on their
                           followers. When people obey them, it makes
                           their SELF feel good. “It’s sin to wear shorts
                           like that or eat pork or watch movies that have
                           magic in them or drink beer or work on Sunday
                           or smoke cigars or play poker or say ‘darn or
                           gosh’ or get a tattoo or pierce your nose or
                           read any version of the Bible other than the
                           King James Version or or…. This form of Pride
                           has kept more people away from God than maybe
                           any other. I know so many people raised in
                           legalistic homes who now, as adults, mock
                           Christians and try to keep people from God.
                           Spiritually abusive people like this understand
                           that Christians won’t follow an arrogant
                           obviously proud person. So they cloak it in
                           religious churchy language and weak and
                           inconsistent biblical justifications. If it’s
                           not black and white in the New Testament, then
                           we are to follow the Holy Spirit’s leading, but
                           the legalistic leader wants us to follow their
                           leading instead. They argue it relentlessly so
                           you’ll obey and they’ll be dominant and their
                           SELF will feel important and be praised.
                              - They misinterpret and misuse the Bible to
                                justify their rules, but their real
                                interest is being right or having control.
                              - They don’t want their kids to look
                                rebellious on the outside because they
                                think that reflects bad on their own SELF
                                and then they will look bad. It’s about
                                appearing spiritual rather than being
                                spiritual.
                           They force their own questionable or easily
                           debatable standards and rules on their
                           followers. When people obey them, it makes
                           their SELF feel good. “It’s sin to wear shorts
                           like that or eat pork or watch movies that have
                           magic in them or drink beer or work on Sunday
                           or smoke cigars or play poker or say ‘darn or
                           gosh’ or get a tattoo or pierce your nose

Submission
                           Prideful people don’t submit easily and rebel
                           against their leaders, spiritual or secular and
                           falsely see it as a weaker position. God as our
                           leader. Wives against their husbands; children
                           against their parents; employees against their
                           bosses; citizens against their government. They
                           believe they can make better decisions than the
                           leader in their lives. And they often can, but
                           it’s not about that.
                           It’s not about the best decision, but it’s
                           about being a faithful follower. It’s important
                           that we share our ideas and wisdom and concerns
                           with those in authority over us and then help
                           make their decision into the best decision.
                           Leadership needs to say, “I’ve heard your idea
                           and their idea. We’re going with their idea. It
                           may not be the best idea, but let’s make it
                           into the best idea. The leader needs to be
                           humble and listen to those they lead,
                           especially when their initial thought wasn’t as
                           good as someone else’s.
                           Prideful people don’t like being told what to
                           do. This doesn’t mean to not question or share
                           wisdom with our leaders, but without a fight,
                           submit.

Hungry for Attention
                           Prideful people get hurt and resent it if they
                           aren’t made mention of and recognized for their
                           accomplishments, acts of service or
                           selflessness. They say and do things for
                           attention and say or do things so that people
                           take great notice of them and regard them
                           highly and talk about them when they’re not
                           there.
                           Prideful people lie. They don’t just embellish
                           a story to make it more entertaining but flat
                           out lie with numbers and circumstances to make
                           their SELF look better.

Self Reliance
                              - Fearful and worry a lot. They put more
                                faith in their plans and ability to take
                                care of themselves than in God to take
                                care of them. And therefore live in fear
                                that their plans will fail. Shows our lack
                                of trust in God and our self-reliance
                                because we are hugely preoccupied with our
                                SELF and don’t have control.
                              - Say they depend on God, but they don’t.
                                They depend on their own abilities.
                              - They hate to rely on others because they
                                believe that help to accomplish something
                                is a sign of weakness.
                              - Don’t often say thank you to God or man,
                                because that would be admitting they
                                needed help and won’t get total credit.
                              - Willing to help others, but not accept
                                help in the same area they helped
                              - Don’t need to pray much because they don’t
                                think they need the help, grace or
                                guidance
                              - Don’t think they need God’s help,
                                direction, grace, courage or hope. So why
                                pray?

Take Credit for Things
                              - Prideful people lie to take credit for
                                things they didn’t do.
                              - Prideful people don’t give compliments or
                                credit to people who deserve it because
                                they think it makes them look bad in
                                contrast.
                              - Don’t like to share praise with others
                              - Prideful people don’t need to pray because
                                that would mean God did it and they
                                wouldn’t get credit for it.
                              - Prideful people shoot down other people’s
                                good ideas because it wasn’t their own and
                                even condition others to eventually stop
                                sharing ideas. They make fun of them or
                                roll their eyes or tell them that they are
                                not wise for saying that.

Workaholic
                           Prideful people are serve or work obsessed,
                           addicted to power and control in a compulsive
                           drive to gain approval and public recognition
                           of success. They believe that their SELF or
                           image, the prestige and status and general
                           emotional well-being they get from being
                           praised for their work or service, is so much
                           more important than the SELF or emotional
                           well-being of their spouse and kids.

                              - Prideful people in leadership positions
                                don’t delegate as often as they should
                                because no one can do it as well or as
                                quickly as they could.

Crave Importance
                           Prideful people feel and believe that value is
                           added to their SELF because of their status or
                           accomplishments. They feel that they are worth
                           more by doing or appearing a certain way.
                              - Purposefully make people wait on them.
                                They seem to enjoy the power of everyone
                                waiting for them. They are regularly late
                                for appointments and meetings that can’t
                                start without them. They like feeling
                                control even though they know they’re
                                causing others to fall behind in their own
                                schedules or are keeping them from
                                important matters. I know a con man who
                                regularly made his wife wait in the car
                                for lunch, sometimes up to three hours
                                beyond when they had agreed. His wife told
                                my wife, “He’s the proudest man I know”.

Overachiever Pride
                              - Sometimes when a child didn’t feel
                                unconditionally loved by their parents or
                                guardians just for who they were, but only
                                for how they performed, then life is a
                                competition to not just do their best, but
                                to do things better than everybody else so
                                they can prove that they are worthy of the
                                love of their parents and friends.

Low Self Esteem
                           True humility isn’t thinking less of your SELF,
                           but thinking of your SELF less. Here is a great
                           psychobabble article about why low self esteem
                           and depression is a huge sign of pride.
                           Humility is seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Knowing what is true about who you
                           are. If you are a naturally gifted musician or
                           have become excellent at tennis through years
                           of hard work, then it’s right to acknowledge
                           that because those are things that are true
                           about your SELF. If humble people are not very
                           good at managing people or not very coordinated
                           or don’t have much fashion sense, they are
                           comfortable admitting it because it’s true
                           about their SELF.
                           Pride is NOT seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Not believing what is accurate and
                           true. If you’re a physically attractive person
                           but tell everyone that you’re ugly or if you
                           have a very likable personality but say that
                           people don’t like you, then that is pride
                           because it isn’t true. Prideful people who
                           aren’t very good at coming up with creative
                           marketing ideas or who are clearly not very
                           good at leading people, won’t stop insisting
                           that they are and are offended if someone
                           speaks the truth to them. Prideful people don’t
                           believe what is true about their SELF.
                              - Won’t ask for forgiveness because that
                                would mean that their SELF isn’t great and
                                was wrong and they are okay living in that
                                sin of not asking for forgiveness. Asking
                                for forgiveness is not dependent on the
                                other person admitting their wrongs too.
                              - Lie about accomplishments and sometimes
                                not just kind of lie, but they lie almost
                                beyond belief. They are desperate for us
                                to think highly of them.

Embarrassed easily
                           Embarrassment is a sign that pride is being
                           attacked.
                             1. Prideful people think they’re above doing
                                lowly tasks and immediately think, “I, of
                                all people, shouldn’t have to do that.
                                That task is for someone lower than
                                myself.”
                             2. Prideful people fear people seeing them
                                doing lowly tasks because they fear that
                                others will think they must not be very
                                powerful or important if they have to do a
                                lowly task.
                             3. Prideful people wait to be served and
                                don’t often serve others because they
                                don’t think of others as more important
                                than themselves.
                             4. Prideful people think they’re better than
                                others. This one can be hard to detect
                                because a person can appear to be humble
                                and caring on the outside.
                             5. Prideful people are easily offended when
                                others question their motives or ability
                                to do something. They say, “Don’t you
                                trust me” or “Don’t you think I know what
                                I’m doing?”
                             6. Depression - Always thinking about the bad
                                condition of their own SELF

Envy
                           When the prince of a kingdom chooses a princess
                           from a neighboring kingdom to be his bride,
                           everybody is happy for her. Nobody is envious.
                           If the prince chooses a local girl from his
                           kingdom to be his bride, then envy is strong
                           from all of the other local girls in the
                           kingdom.
                           Envy is the feeling of discontent or resentful
                           longing for somebody else’s career, good looks,
                           talent, job promotion, wisdom, fame, social
                           position, spirituality, character, sense of
                           humor, wealth, possessions or other status
                           symbols or positive qualities. By having those
                           things, they think they’ll show everybody that
                           the lie they have slowly come to believe about
                           their SELF is true. It is especially hard on
                           them when someone who is their equal rises
                           above them economically or in social standing.
                             1. Prideful people believe others are envious
                                of them because “wouldn’t everybody be
                                envious of what I’ve got?”
                             2. Prideful are envious when the spotlight is
                                on someone they feel they are superior to.
                                Then they whisper to the person next to
                                them, “They’re not all that”.
                             3. Prideful people sabotage other people’s
                                work or don’t use someone else’s good idea
                                because they think that if that person is
                                praised, then they will look lesser.

Materialism
                           Prideful people try to impress with their
                           success by showing us their possessions.
                           Prideful people are not generous with their
                           money. They are SELF-ish and would rather use
                           their money to buy things that they feel
                           validate their untrue feelings of who they
                           are.

Defensiveness
                              - Think the best defense is a great offense
                                when their SELF feels attacked (when their
                                pride is hurt).
                              - They condition people to NEVER confront
                                them again by attacking them back with
                                their past mistakes or failures so it
                                takes the focus off of the prideful
                                person’s problem.
                              - Prideful people make up excuses when
                                they’re corrected or criticized.
                              - Prideful people say things like,
                                “Everybody makes mistakes” or “you make
                                mistakes too” when they have no choice but
                                to accept blame.

Depression
                           There are a lot of legitimate medical and
                           traumatic reasons for depression. Focus on SELF
                           and believing what’s not true about their SELF,
                           is a common reason. Pride is a major cause of
                           depression for millions of people.

Shyness
                           We can be wired as introverts purposefully by
                           God from birth. This isn’t about introverts or
                           extroverts
                              - Prideful people are very shy. They are
                                overly concerned with others’ opinions of
                                them which is usually a reflection of
                                being obsessed with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t invite people to
                                their home because it’s not nice enough or
                                they can’t afford to entertain big.
                              - Prideful people have a hard time sharing
                                their real spiritual needs or other junk
                                because they’re afraid they won’t be liked
                                anymore.
                              - Prideful people fear what people will
                                think of them and are overly consumed with
                                man’s opinion of their SELF which is
                                usually a sign of obsession with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t like reaching out
                                and being friendly at church or in other
                                social settings.

Pride of Appearance
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re valuable and they believe their SELF is
                           more valuable if it looks good
                           Arrogance, Immodesty, Narcissism, Pomposity,
                           Pride, Self-Importance, Self-Love, Self-regard,
                           smugness, swagger, self-admiration,
                           self-exaltation, swelled head, conceited,
                           display, pretension, self-worship, show,
                           ostentation,
                           We should take healthy pride in our appearance
                           and do the best with what we’ve got and for our
                           spouse. Dignity is a good thing. But this is
                           not:

Understanding Why We Have Pride and How it Works
                           God wants us to be proud of our work or family
                           or to try the best with what we’ve got. And
                           when we’re recognized and affirmed for doing
                           well, it feels good and right. That’s healthy
                           pride. The apostle Paul said that he was
                           “proud” of some of the early churches.
                           When we’re supported, protected and affirmed
                           growing up, then that builds a solid firm
                           structure or base inside of us. It gives us a
                           STRONG ego, or good sense of what’s true about
                           our SELF. It’s a good and healthy thing. If we
                           weren’t supported, protected and affirmed, then
                           we often develop a BIG ego. And that’s no
                           bueno. Since a strong floor or structure wasn’t
                           built up inside of us to tell us what our SELF
                           is accurately worth, we have to guess at our
                           value or worth.
                           So we try to build up or inflate our SELF to
                           where we think a healthy place should be, but
                           usually over-inflate or prop it up way higher
                           than what is accurate by saying and doing
                           things to show others what we’ve guessed is
                           accurate about us. And that’s when the praise
                           and worship of us starts and that makes us
                           think that what we believe about our SELF is
                           true. Pride can even distort our mind to think
                           that even our junk is good and right.

Conclusion
                           I really hope this list and explanation has
                           helped you understand what pride really looks
                           like and has given you a desire to not have it
                           in your life. And remember, don’t shoot the
                           messenger.
