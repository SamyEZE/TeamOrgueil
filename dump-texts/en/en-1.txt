   [220px-Allegory_of_Pride_Met_DP888806.jpg] Allegory of pride, from c.
   1590–1630, engraving, 22.3 cm × 16.6 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of
   Art (New York City)

   Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or
   "confidence and satisfaction in oneself".^[1] Oxford defines it as "the
   quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own
   importance."^[2] Pride may be related to one's own abilities or
   achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's
   country. Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of
   oneself",^[3] as opposed to false pride or narcissism. Similarly, St.
   Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence",^[4] and
   Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism
   manifests."^[5]

   Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a
   complex secondary emotion that requires the development of a sense of
   self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that
   pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based
   interaction with others.^[6] Some social psychologists identify the
   nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional,
   automatically perceived signal of high social status.^[7]

   Pride may be considered the opposite of shame or of humility,^[8]
   sometimes as proper or as a virtue, and sometimes as corrupt or as a
   vice. With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of
   attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward
   a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent
   self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Other possible
   objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sex identity (for
   example LGBT pride).^[citation needed] With a negative connotation
   pride refers to a foolishly^[9] and irrationally corrupt sense of one's
   personal value, status or accomplishments,^[10] used synonymously with
   hubris.

   While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw)
   consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions
   consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in
   Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root
   of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known
   as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed
   as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt,
   vanity, or vainglory.

Etymology[edit]

   Proud comes from late Old English prut, probably from Old French prud
   "brave, valiant" (11th century) (which became preux in French), from
   Late Latin term prodis "useful", which is compared with the Latin
   prodesse "be of use".^[11] The sense of "having a high opinion of
   oneself", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the
   Norman knights who called themselves "proud".^[12]

Ancient Greek philosophy[edit]

   Aristotle identified pride (megalopsuchia, variously translated as
   proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity)^[13] as the crown
   of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and
   humility, thus:

     By a high-minded man we seem to mean one who claims much and
     deserves much: for he who claims much without deserving it is a
     fool; but the possessor of a virtue is never foolish or silly. The
     man we have described, then, is high-minded. He who deserves little
     and claims little is temperate [or modest], but not high-minded: for
     high-mindedness [or greatness of soul] implies greatness, just as
     beauty implies stature; small men may be neat and well proportioned,
     but cannot be called beautiful.^[14]

   He concludes then that

     High-mindedness, then, seems to be the crowning grace, as it were,
     of the virtues; it makes them greater, and cannot exist without
     them. And on this account it is a hard thing to be truly
     high-minded; for it is impossible without the union of all the
     virtues.^[14]

   By contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows:

     to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen
     to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for
     your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries;
     this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this:
     naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own
     superiority the greater.^[15]

   Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for
   Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing
   from pride.

Psychology[edit]

   Pride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and
   evaluative; its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the
   self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies
   with.^[10] The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame
   as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of
   oneself and one's behavior according to internal and external
   standards.^[16] Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a
   standard; guilt or shame from defying it. There is a lack of research
   that addresses pride, perhaps because it is despised as well as valued
   in the individualist West, where it is experienced as pleasurable.^[17]

  Emotion[edit]

   In psychological terms, positive pride is "a pleasant, sometimes
   exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive
   self-evaluation".^[18] It was added to the University of California,
   Davis, "Set of Emotion Expressions", as one of three "self-conscious"
   emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with
   embarrassment and shame).^[19]

   The term "fiero" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to
   describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a
   personal triumph over adversity.^[20] Facial expressions and gestures
   that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or
   arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant
   status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in
   cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show
   that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is
   automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status
   in a group.^[7]

   Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded
   posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from
   the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in
   congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see
   it in others.^[21]

  Positive outcomes[edit]

   Pride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal
   goals; for example positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a
   person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person
   alone.^[22]^[full citation needed]

   Pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of
   similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak
   others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a
   hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid
   negotiations of conflict.^[23]

   Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It
   is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where
   the individual is proud".^[24]^[full citation needed] Pride is
   associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and
   outward promotion^[clarification needed]. Along with hope, it is an
   emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger
   and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming
   evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility
   of the effort expended.^[25]^[full citation needed] Pride can enhance
   creativity, productivity, and altruism.^[26]^[full citation needed]
   Pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically
   advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods,
   pride is associated with a lower GPA.^[27]

  Economics[edit]

   In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a
   spectrum ranging from "proper pride", associated with genuine
   achievements, and "false pride", which can be maladaptive or even
   pathological. Lea et al. examined the role of pride in various economic
   situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because
   economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are
   linked together by the selfhood of the people who take
   them^[clarification needed].^[28] Understood in this way, pride is an
   emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial
   decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short
   term they would appear irrational.

  Sin and self-acceptance[edit]

   See also: Self-esteem § Contingent vs. non-contingent

   [180px-Pride%2C_Jacob_Matham.png] Pride, from the Seven Deadly Sins by
   Jacob Matham c. 1592.

   Inordinate self-esteem is called "pride".^[29] Classical Christian
   theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and
   thus^[non sequitur] high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human
   problem, but beginning in the 20th century, "humanistic psychology"
   diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a
   lack of belief in one's "true worth". Carl Rogers observed that most
   people "regard themselves as worthless and unlovable." Thus, they lack
   self-esteem.^[30]^: 40, 87, 95 

   In the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled
   with the term, "Haughty".

     Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

   — King James Version of the Bible (1611), Book of Proverbs, 16:18

   Terry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as
   an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He
   examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride
   is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the
   experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does
   not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic
   psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front
   designed to protect an undervalued self.^[30]

   He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts,
   namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in dealing with^[clarification
   needed] what he calls a "deadlock between the overvalued and
   undervalued self".^[30]^: 112–13  Cooper refers to their work in
   describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as
   well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an
   appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:

     The "idealized self," the "tyranny of the should," the "pride
     system", and the nature of self-hate all point toward the
     intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt.
     Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of
     self-contempt and low self-esteem.^[sentence
     fragment]^[30]^: 112–13 

   Thus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes
   actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the hubristic
   person feels deep down.

  Hubris and group narcissism[edit]

   Main article: Hubris

   See also: Group narcissism

   Hubris is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and
   is commonly related to^[clarification needed] expressions of aggression
   and hostility.^[31]^[full citation needed] Hubris is not necessarily
   associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or
   variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to
   create conflict and sometimes to terminate close relationships, which
   has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear
   positive or adaptive functions.^[32]^[full citation needed]

   A group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a
   group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other
   groups.^[33]^[better source needed] "[H]ubristic, pompous displays of
   group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of
   strength,"^[This quote needs a citation] while those who express pride
   by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and
   hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public
   and personal eyes.

   Research from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride
   correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement and promotes
   prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with
   self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes
   toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.^[34]

  Across the world[edit]

   Pride in ones own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally
   have positive connotations,^[dubious – discuss]^[35] though like
   earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have
   been known to commit atrocities.^[36]

   Types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The
   difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the
   U.S. and China.^[ambiguous]^[37] In the U.S., individual pride
   tends^[clarification needed] and seems to be held more often in
   thought. The people in China seem to hold greater views^[clarification
   needed] for the nation as a whole.^[38]

   The value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to
   be a running theme and debate among cultures.^[39] This debate shadows
   the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride
   shouldn't be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about
   which form of it is the most useful.^[39]

   Pride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures
   largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was
   popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late
   sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk
   named Evagrius Ponticus in the fourth century as one of the evils human
   beings should resist. ^[40]

  German[edit]

   offspring of Greed and Pride.

   Main article: German nationalism

   In Germany, "national pride" ("Nationalstolz") is often associated with
   Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to
   be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate
   about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in
   Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not
   seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant
   support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team
   progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support
   across the nation.^[41]

  Asian[edit]

   Main article: Asian pride

   The term "Asian pride" in modern usage refers mostly to those of East
   Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian
   pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had
   conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese
   religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged
   prominently during European colonialism.^[42] At one time, Europeans
   controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in
   anti-Western feelings among Asian nations.^[42] Today, some Asians
   still look upon European involvement in their affairs with
   suspicion.^[42] In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by
   adherents of Asian Pride.

  Black[edit]

   Main article: Black pride

   Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise
   awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by
   African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin or ancestry to denote a
   feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one's heritage,
   and being proud of one's worth.

  White[edit]

   Main article: White pride

   White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white
   separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist
   organizations in the United States for a white race
   identity.^[43]^[full citation needed] White pride also consists of
   white ethnic/cultural pride.

   Mad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that mentally ill
   people should be proud of their madness. It advocates mutual support
   and rallies for their rights,^[44] and aims to popularize the word
   "mad" as a self-descriptor.^[45]

   LGBT pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals
   should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT
   pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT
   people.^[46] The movement has three main premises: that people should
   be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual
   diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity
   are inherent and cannot be intentionally
   altered.^[47]^[better source needed]

   The word "pride" is used in this case as an antonym for "shame". It is
   an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement
   began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the
   first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year
   anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising
   between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of
   Stonewall Inn.^[48]

Vanity[edit]

   Main article: Vanity

   [220px-Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_%28Superbia%29.jpg]
   Detail of "Pride" in The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things by
   Hieronymus Bosch

   In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense
   to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness,
   and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers
   to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one's abilities
   or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in that sense be
   compared to pride. The term vanity originates from the Latin word
   vanitas meaning emptiness, untruthfulness, futility, foolishness, and
   empty pride.^[49] Here empty pride means a fake pride, in the sense of
   vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but
   sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.
   [220px-Alexandre_Cabanel_-_Fallen_Angel.jpg] "The Fallen Angel" (1847)

   21%2C_NGA_5360.jpg] Jacques Callot, Pride (Vanity), probably after 1621

   In many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in
   which one rejects God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby
   becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and
   Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a
   pernicious aspect of vanity.

   In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in
   Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity
   was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or
   reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with a comb and mirror.
   The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols of
   vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of
   death himself.
   [170px-Allisvanity.jpg] "All Is Vanity" by C. Allan Gilbert, evoking
   the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward death

   Often depicted is an inscription on a scroll that reads Omnia Vanitas
   ("All is Vanity"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of
   Ecclesiastes.^[50] Although that phrase—itself depicted in a type of
   still life called vanitas—originally referred not to an obsession with
   one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in
   this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the
   subject of the picture. "The artist invites us to pay lip-service to
   condemning her", writes Edwin Mullins, "while offering us full
   permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while
   we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind
   of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her."^[51]
   The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the
   non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.

   In his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a
   bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind
   her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier,
   which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is An Allegory of Justice and
   Vanity. A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does
   not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer's
   famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is sometimes believed to
   depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before
   a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.^[52] All is
   Vanity, by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An
   optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large
   grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a
   young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror of her vanity table.
   Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of
   youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the
   inevitability of death.
