   Are you lacking a little confidence?

   It might be time to get in touch with your pride.

   These pride quotes will inspire you into action.

   What do you think of when you hear the word “pride”?

   Many people think of “pride” as being something bad, as in “pride goes
   before the fall”.

   And while it’s true that pride can become negative if you are too
   caught up in it, it’s also important.

   Having pride in yourself, your abilities, and even your surroundings
   can be motivating towards action.

   When people are proud of where they live, they help take care of it.

   When a person is proud of their abilities, they aren’t afraid to step
   out and put it to use.

   Healthy pride can build up your confidence as shown in these pride
   quotes.
