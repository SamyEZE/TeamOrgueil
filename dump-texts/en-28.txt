Unite for Pride in Türkiye

   Pride is under threat in Türkiye after years of marches being banned.
   People have the right to love who they love and be who they are, freely
   and without discrimination. Send a message of support to LGBTI people
   and their allies in Türkiye now.

What’s the problem?

   In Türkiye, Pride faces a battle on two major fronts: LGBTI rights are
   under increasing attack, while the right to protest has been severely
   limited for years. Since 2015, Pride events have been systemically
   banned in Türkiye, preventing LGBTI people from demanding their rights.

   Now, as well as threatening to crack down on Pride in 2023, prominent
   figures are ramping up anti-LGBTI rhetoric with increasing
   discrimination against LGBTI people being observed.

   So now, more than ever, we must take a firm stance against these human
   rights violations.

   We must protect LGBTI rights and the right to protest. We must unite
   for Türkiye Pride.

What you can do to help?

   Send a message of support to LGBTI people and their allies in Türkiye
   now. Together we are more powerful.
