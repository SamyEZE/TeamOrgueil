   [220px-Allegory_of_Pride_Met_DP888806.jpg] Allegory of pride, from c.
   1590–1630, engraving, 22.3 cm × 16.6 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of
   Art (New York City)

   Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or
   "confidence and satisfaction in oneself".^[1] Oxford defines it as "the
   quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own
   importance."^[2] Pride may be related to one's own abilities or
   achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's
   country. Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of
   oneself",^[3] as opposed to false pride or narcissism. Similarly, St.
   Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence",^[4] and
   Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism
   manifests."^[5]

   Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a
   complex secondary emotion that requires the development of a sense of
   self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that
   pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based
   interaction with others.^[6] Some social psychologists identify the
   nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional,
   automatically perceived signal of high social status.^[7]

   Pride may be considered the opposite of shame or of humility,^[8]
   sometimes as proper or as a virtue, and sometimes as corrupt or as a
   vice. With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of
   attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward
   a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent
   self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Other possible
   objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sex identity (for
   example LGBT pride).^[citation needed] With a negative connotation
   pride refers to a foolishly^[9] and irrationally corrupt sense of one's
   personal value, status or accomplishments,^[10] used synonymously with
   hubris.

   While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw)
   consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions
   consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in
   Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root
   of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known
   as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed
   as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt,
   vanity, or vainglory.

Ancient Greek philosophy[edit]

   Aristotle identified pride (megalopsuchia, variously translated as
   proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity)^[13] as the crown
   of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and
   humility, thus:

--
     naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own
     superiority the greater.^[15]

   Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for
   Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing
   from pride.

Psychology[edit]

   Pride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and
   evaluative; its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the
   self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies
   with.^[10] The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame
   as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of
   oneself and one's behavior according to internal and external
   standards.^[16] Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a
   standard; guilt or shame from defying it. There is a lack of research
   that addresses pride, perhaps because it is despised as well as valued
   in the individualist West, where it is experienced as pleasurable.^[17]

  Emotion[edit]

   In psychological terms, positive pride is "a pleasant, sometimes
   exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive
   self-evaluation".^[18] It was added to the University of California,
   Davis, "Set of Emotion Expressions", as one of three "self-conscious"
--
   embarrassment and shame).^[19]

   The term "fiero" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to
   describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a
   personal triumph over adversity.^[20] Facial expressions and gestures
   that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or
   arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant
   status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in
   cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show
   that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is
   automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status
   in a group.^[7]

   Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded
   posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from
   the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in
   congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see
--

  Positive outcomes[edit]

   Pride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal
   goals; for example positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a
   person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person
   alone.^[22]^[full citation needed]

   Pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of
   similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak
   others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a
   hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid
   negotiations of conflict.^[23]

   Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It
   is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where
   the individual is proud".^[24]^[full citation needed] Pride is
   associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and
   outward promotion^[clarification needed]. Along with hope, it is an
   emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger
   and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming
   evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility
   of the effort expended.^[25]^[full citation needed] Pride can enhance
   creativity, productivity, and altruism.^[26]^[full citation needed]
   Pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically
   advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods,
   pride is associated with a lower GPA.^[27]

  Economics[edit]

   In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a
   spectrum ranging from "proper pride", associated with genuine
   achievements, and "false pride", which can be maladaptive or even
   pathological. Lea et al. examined the role of pride in various economic
   situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because
   economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are
   linked together by the selfhood of the people who take
   them^[clarification needed].^[28] Understood in this way, pride is an
   emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial
   decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short
   term they would appear irrational.

   Jacob Matham c. 1592.

   Inordinate self-esteem is called "pride".^[29] Classical Christian
   theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and
   thus^[non sequitur] high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human
   problem, but beginning in the 20th century, "humanistic psychology"
   diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a
--
   people "regard themselves as worthless and unlovable." Thus, they lack
   self-esteem.^[30]^: 40, 87, 95 

   In the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled
   with the term, "Haughty".

     Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

   — King James Version of the Bible (1611), Book of Proverbs, 16:18

   Terry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as
   an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He
   examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride
   is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the
   experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does
   not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic
   psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front
   designed to protect an undervalued self.^[30]

   He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts,
   namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in dealing with^[clarification
   needed] what he calls a "deadlock between the overvalued and
   undervalued self".^[30]^: 112–13  Cooper refers to their work in
   describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as
   well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an
   appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:

     The "idealized self," the "tyranny of the should," the "pride
     system", and the nature of self-hate all point toward the
     intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt.

   A group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a
   group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other
   groups.^[33]^[better source needed] "[H]ubristic, pompous displays of
   group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of
   strength,"^[This quote needs a citation] while those who express pride
   by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and
   hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public
   and personal eyes.

   Research from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride
   correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement and promotes
   prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with
   self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes
   toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.^[34]

  Across the world[edit]

   Pride in ones own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally
   have positive connotations,^[dubious – discuss]^[35] though like
   earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have
   been known to commit atrocities.^[36]

   Types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The
   difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the
   U.S. and China.^[ambiguous]^[37] In the U.S., individual pride
   tends^[clarification needed] and seems to be held more often in
   thought. The people in China seem to hold greater views^[clarification
   needed] for the nation as a whole.^[38]

   The value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to
   be a running theme and debate among cultures.^[39] This debate shadows
   the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride
   shouldn't be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about
   which form of it is the most useful.^[39]

   Pride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures
   largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was
   popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late
   sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk

   In Germany, "national pride" ("Nationalstolz") is often associated with
   Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to
   be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate

  Asian[edit]

   The term "Asian pride" in modern usage refers mostly to those of East
   Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian
   pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had
   conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese
   religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged
   prominently during European colonialism.^[42] At one time, Europeans
   controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in
   anti-Western feelings among Asian nations.^[42] Today, some Asians
   still look upon European involvement in their affairs with
   suspicion.^[42] In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by
   adherents of Asian Pride.

   Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise

   White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white

   organizations in the United States for a white race
   identity.^[43]^[full citation needed] White pride also consists of
   white ethnic/cultural pride.

   Mad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that mentally ill
   people should be proud of their madness. It advocates mutual support
   and rallies for their rights,^[44] and aims to popularize the word
   "mad" as a self-descriptor.^[45]

   LGBT pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals
   should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT
   pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT
   people.^[46] The movement has three main premises: that people should
   be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual
   diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity
   are inherent and cannot be intentionally
   altered.^[47]^[better source needed]

   The word "pride" is used in this case as an antonym for "shame". It is
   an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement
   began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the
   first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year
   anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising
   between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of
   Stonewall Inn.^[48]

   Hieronymus Bosch

   In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense
   to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness,
   and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers
   to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one's abilities
   or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in that sense be
   compared to pride. The term vanity originates from the Latin word
   vanitas meaning emptiness, untruthfulness, futility, foolishness, and
   empty pride.^[49] Here empty pride means a fake pride, in the sense of
   vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but
   sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.

Design for Pride in the Workplace

     * Yichen Lu^1 &amp;

Background

   Pride is one of the most meaningful experiences in daily life. Many
   psychological studies emphasize self-oriented and event-based
   achievements as the main sources of pride, whereas work from
   organizational management considers pride as a collective attitude
   derived from other-focused activities and fostered by the sense of
   belongingness. Taking the interdisciplinary aspects of pride into
   account, this article addresses the challenge of how experience design
   can contribute to pride experience in the workplace.

Methods

   By cross-cutting theories from psychology and organizational
   management, this study introduces a framework of dynamic pride. The
   data includes 20 experience design cases that were specifically devoted
   to positive experiences in the context of the metal and engineering
   industry. 33 pride-related experience design goals were analyzed and
   categorized into the framework of pride.

Results

   This study introduces the social and temporal dimensions of pride
   experience at work. The pride-related experience design goals fall into
   four categories: self-focused short-term pride, self-focused long-term
   pride, other-focused short-term pride, and other-focused long-term
   pride. Accordingly, the extracted design strategies of these goals were
   mapped to each type of pride. Most of these design strategies were
   clustered in the categories of self-focused short-term pride and
   other-focused long-term pride.

Conclusions

   This study reveals the design strategies for dynamics of pride in the
   workplace varying from evoking self-achievement in individual
   interactions with tools to maintaining long-term motivation of
   self-competence development, and from highlighting one’s contribution
   in face-to-face collaborative work facilitated by interactive tools to
   fostering co-experience of organizational pride throughout social
   events.

Background
--
   specific experience in a targeted context.

   This study aims to investigate design strategies for human flourishing
   with a special focus on pride experience in the workplace, because the
   nature of pride is full of richness regarding meaningful experiences at
   work. According to the positive computing framework (Calvo and Peters
   2014, p. 87), pride covers the dimension from intra-personal pride that
   is experienced within oneself (e.g., feelings of self-achievement) to
   interpersonal pride that is experienced from interaction between
   oneself and others (e.g., perception of respect from others). From the
   perspective of time, pride can be experienced as a moment-by-moment
   positive emotion evoked by unstable events, such as success in a
   challenging task. Also, pride can be considered as a cumulative
   experience based on a long-term rational attitude, such as loyalty
   towards one’s community. In contrast to the richness of pride, current
   design research studies provide limited sources of design for pride,
   which are mainly constrained by the mere scope of product design and
   the perspective of self-achievement and personal distinct possession
   (Desmet 2012).

   Pride as a meaningful experience design goal in the workplace is worth
   investigating further. This study specifically strives to provide
   designers concrete design-for-pride strategies from two angles: the
   literature review on the multiple facets of pride and the empirical
   data on pride embodiment in design concepts. Accordingly, with a
   special focus on workplace, this study addresses two research
   questions: first, to identify what are the dimensions of pride that
   help designers to understand the design space for pride experience;
   second, to distinguish the strategies that designers have used so far
   in the design-for-pride cases. By synthesizing theoretical and
   empirical knowledge, this study proposes a multi-dimensional framework
   of design-mediated pride^Footnote 1 and the design strategies for
   evoking dynamics of pride in the workplace.

   The remaining sections of this paper are structured accordingly: first,
   a theoretical framework of pride based on literature review is
   presented and the need of knowledge on design-mediated pride is
   identified; second, 20 cases that were designed for positive experience
   at work are analyzed based on self-focus to other-focus dimensions and
   short-term to long-term timespans; third, derived from these cases, the
   design strategies for evoking pride experience at work are proposed;
   finally, the insights from these design strategies are discussed.

Literature Review

Psychological Structure of Pride

   Pride is a fundamental human emotion involving a complex
   self-evaluative process (Tracy and Robins 2004). Different from other
   “purely” basic emotions, such as the universally admired emotion of
   love or the universally reviled emotion of jealousy (Williams and
   DeSteno 2009), pride is comprised of two distinct facets. To this
   extent, Tangney (1990) referred to “alpha” pride as pride in self and
   “beta” pride as pride in behavior. Furthermore, Tracy and Robins (2004)
   distinguished between authentic pride and hubristic pride: authentic
   pride is evoked by accomplishment from successful behavior and
   positively related to genuine self-esteem and prosocial traits, whereas
   hubristic pride is more towards self-aggrandizement and positively
   related to narcissism (Tracy et al. 2014). Additionally, the two facets
   of pride differ from each other in cognitive antecedents (Tracy and
   Robins 2007b). Authentic pride is triggered more by unstable, specific,
   and controllable attributions, such as solid results due to hard work,
   whereas hubristic pride is more likely to occur from stable, global,
   and uncontrollable causes, such as feelings of superiority from “who I
   am” (Tracy and Robins 2007b). As this study focuses on designing for
   positive pride, hubristic pride is excluded in the scope of this paper.

Self-Focus Versus Other-Focus

   Both self- and other-focused pride are sources of positive emotion
   (Desmet 2012); moreover, the categories of self and social have been
   identified as wellbeing factors (Calvo and Peters 2014). Self-focused
   pride emphasizes more on interaction within oneself and response to
   oneself whereas other-focused pride accentuates interpersonal
   interaction and the influence between self and others. Most studies
   emphasize pride as a self-conscious and performance-related experience
   triggered by self-efficacy (Tracy and Robins 2007a). Besides its
   elicitation through self-achievement, pride as a fundamental social
   emotion can also be “generated by appraisals when one is responsible
   for a socially valued outcome or for being a socially valued person”
   (Mascolo and Fischer 1995, p. 66). Moral accomplishment and prosocial
   actions are associated with the feeling of pride that may motivate and
   reinforce one’s socially valued conduct (Tangney et al. 2007), such as
   caregiving (Tracy and Robins 2007b), treating others well (Michie
   2009), and positively responding to others’ emotions and needs (Leffel
   et al. 2008). Nakamura’s (2013) related work suggests that compared
   with self-oriented achievement, other-oriented prosocial action has an
   even stronger relationship to pride in both family life and work life.
   Therefore, no matter whether it is triggered by self-oriented task
   accomplishment or other-oriented altruistic activities, pride functions
   as both a “barometer” and “motivator” (McCullough et al. 2001) in
   assessing, regulating, and encouraging one’s behavior toward being
   “good, competent, and virtuous” (Haidt 2003, p. 860).

Short-Term Versus Long-Term

   Pride derived from subjective histories of success may promote
   eagerness towards new anticipatory goals (Katzenbach 2003b). This
   promotion-related eagerness may energize and enhance performance
   (Higgins et al. 2001) and thus renew the experience of pride. As such,
   pride can transition from a temporary emotional experience towards a
   durable attitude of pride. According to the timespans of user
   experience (Roto et al. 2011), a new challenging goal may evoke an
   anticipatory pride for a person with a subjective history of success
   (Higgins et al. 2001); incremental progress in problem solving may
   elicit a momentary pride; when reflecting on an overcome challenge, a
   person may feel an episodic pride in the achievement. These
   performance-related types of pride are short-term, event-specific, and
   ascribed to internal attributes, such as ability or effort (Weiner
   1985). Additionally, another kind of long-term and cognitive
   attitudinal pride exists in organizational studies, which does not rely
   on single events, but cumulative experience related to the overall
   evaluation of a target (Gouthier and Rhein 2011), such as being proud
   of one’s community.

Pride Experience at Work

   Pride is one of the most intense experiences in work life (Katzenbach
   2003b), and work itself is a source of pride (Hodson 1998). Katzenbach
   (2003b) distinguishes institution-building pride which is based on
   largely intangible value and collective interest from self-serving
   pride which is driven by power and materialism.

   Employees can take intrinsic pride in what they make, how they work,
   and whom they work with (Katzenbach 2003b). Experience of pride in
   achievement can be empathized by others in social interaction at work
   and thereby contribute to psychological empowerment and promote future
   successes (Froman 2010). Katzenbach (2003b) introduces a powerful
   “closed loop of energy” derived from pride: better performance
   contributes to business success, and recognized business success
   instills a strong feeling of pride, which fuels future better
   performance. This cycle can be repeatedly applied in organizational
   management.

   Gouthier and Rhein (2011) discern two types of organizational pride:
   one is an emotional pride triggered by successful organizational
   events, and the other is a cognitive and durable attitude of pride
   oriented from the general perception of the organization and employees’
   sense of belonging to the organization (Lea and Webley 1997). On this
   matter, the celebration of successful events, presence of a successful
   company history and culture, and successful advertising campaigns have
   been identified as activators of organizational pride (Gouthier and
   Rhein 2011).

   In summary, pride experience can be derived from self-focused
   achievement and other-focused interpersonal interaction. The richness
   of pride also lies in covering a timespan from a temporary emotion to a
   durable attitude. Pride can be intensively experienced in the
   workplace, and intrinsic pride can be evoked by organizational
   celebration and reputation. From the psychology and organizational
   management literature review, two dimensions of pride were identified
   relevant for design: social dimension from self-focused to
   other-focused and temporal dimension from short-term to long-term
   (Fig. 1).

Design for Pride Experience

   Recently, design researchers have started to explore how design can
   contribute to pride experience. Desmet (2012) introduced pride among
   the 25 positive emotions in the scope of human-product interactions:
   pride may be evoked by owning a unique product, being able to use a
   complex product, achieving something a product facilitates, or
   receiving positive feedback from others concerning the product one
   owns. Based on Desmet’s work, Yoon et al. (2013) developed a tool to
   facilitate emotional granularity in design and specified that pride may
   be triggered by “one’s praiseworthy behavior surpassing internal and
   external standard, and/or one recognizes that others appreciate it”
   (ibid., p.8). Compared with the two dimensions of pride (Fig. 1), pride
   as a collective experience in social interaction (Battarbee and
   Koskinen 2005) and the long-term cumulative experience has not yet been
   fully addressed in existing experience design theories.

   One example of positive design for pride given by Desmet and Pohlmeyer
   (2013) is a designed social interactive activity in which patients with
   dementia can match record pieces in order to play music from their past
   on a turntable with others; thus, a feeling of pride may arise from
   task completion within the social interaction. Moreover, two cases of
   work tool design for meaningful experience at work (Lu and Roto 2015)
   indicate that employees may feel proud of mastering a tool and being
   part of an organization; meanwhile, customers may experience pride when
   they make a right decision on a tool purchase and present manufactured
   tools to their clients. These design examples suggest how designers
   shape the conditions that may evoke a pride experience in a specific
   context. These cases reveal different strategies of designing for
   dynamics of pride. On one hand, those theoretical sources of pride,
   such as achievement, competence, owning something special, and positive
   appraisal from self and others, are clearly embodied in these three
   cases. On the other hand, when referring to a pride experience in a
   specific context, designers seem to employ specific context-adapted
   design strategies, such as utilizing the positive relationship between
   personalized music and a patient with dementia, developing the
--

   Because the nature of design knowledge is highly applicable and
   practice-driven (Cross 2001), besides the theoretical perspective, it
   is meaningful to examine how different types of pride were designed for
   in the concrete cases. This study aims to help designers to discover
   profound and unique sources of pride experience in the specific context
   of the workplace. The design-for-pride strategies employed by the
   collected cases will be identified and analyzed against the theoretical
   dimensions of pride (Fig. 1).

   company personnel were available for providing information and
   comments. At least one of the authors followed these cases by arranging
   weekly meetings with the design teams and reading their design diaries.
   The students were not given special guidance for designing for pride,
   as pride was not a presumed design goal in any of the assignments.
   Rather, the students were trained to identify multiple profound
   experience goals for the targeted workplace contexts. Only after a
   majority of cases ended up pride-related experience goals, the authors
   got interested in a deeper study of pride experience at work. Hence the
   analysis of the design cases was retrospective and the final reports of
   the student teams served as the primary data source for this part of
   the research.
--
   The design case description can provide better understanding of the
   experience design in the industrial workplace context. Due to the
   limited length of this article, this section will shortly describe four
   example cases that tackled pride from different perspectives.

   The customer for the first experience design case was Kemppi, a
   manufacturer of welding machines. The task was to design a mobile
--
   welding skills with welding without the actual welding equipment, but
   rather with the help of a welding simulator game. The design students
   drew three experience goals: Pleasure (the joy of welding),
   Self-motivation (willingness to practice constantly), and Pride (about
   their skills, the results, and the welding itself). The Pleasure goal
   was tackled by gamification features; Self-motivation by sharing and
   communicating the progress; and Pride by a physical certificate after
   completing all levels of training (Fig. 2). The incremental concept was
   a mobile application as suggested in the assignment, and the radical
   concept focused on the best possible pride experience by inviting
   selected application users to showcase their real-life welding skills
   in an event similar to an art exhibition.

   focusing on the maintenance services of cranes at waste-to-energy
   plants. After studying the employees at the plant, the students set
   goals for the crane maintenance service experience. Of the three goals,
   two were related to the pride experience: Worthiness (an affirmation of
   their importance as a customer) and Belongingness (a meaningful
   relationship with Konecranes employees). The radical concept is called
   Mood sphere, consisting of a light ball at the plant and an identity
--
   experience in mind, since the salesperson is the primary user of the
   simulator. The students utilized the metaphor of Q from the James Bond
   movies and set three experience goals that all were related to the
   experience of pride: Sense of directing (directing the situation by
   suggesting possible solutions), Expertise (presenting oneself as a
   professional, technical expert), and Pride (proudly representing the
   company). The design strategy to fulfill the Sense of directing goal
   was to boost the feeling of control; Expertise goal by using impressive
   technology; and Pride by drawing attention with a novel way of
   presentation. The radical solution proposed by the students was a
   simulator vehicle, similar to a Segway, with the steering joysticks
   mounted on it (Fig. 4).

   into a visitor space. In this case, the company already had defined
   company-wide experience goals (Roto et al. 2015) for experience
   development projects, from which the students derived four experience
   goals for this specific case. One of these was Participation for pride,
   which aims to foster a pride experience in customers by being able to
   influence the development activities at Fastems. In addition to the
   physical space design in the center of the factory activities, students
   proposed an interactive table as a collaboration platform• in the space

Selecting Pride-Related Experience Goals

   To decide whether a case is an endeavor for evoking a pride experience
   at work, the authors analyzed the final reports of all student teams,
   and examined the description of each experience goal setting and its
   infusion into a design concept. Compared to the existing guidance on
   designing for pride, this study adopted a broader and deeper
   understanding of pride based on the literature study. Besides the
   experience goals literally labeled with “pride”, those having the
   potential to elicit pride experience were also taken into account as
   pride-related experience goals and their relevance to pride is
   indicated in Table 1. The researchers interpreted the implication of
   these goals situated in the design context rather than their original
   meaning. For example, in the Kemppi case introduced above, pride as a
   long-term experience is based on a momentary pleasurable pride and
   episodic evaluative pride in self-motivation and thus Pleasure and
   Self-motivation are grouped into pride-related experience goals. On the
   other hand, if the experience goals and their embodiment in the final
   concepts both have little connection with pride, then these goals are
   excluded in this study.
   Table 1 The experience goals with high relevance to pride
   Full size table

   In these 20 design cases, altogether 61 experience goals were
   identified and more than half (33) of them were pride-related.
   Meanwhile, only two cases out of 20 have little connection with pride:
   one stressed Discovery as an experience in taking an elevator; the
   other focused on a Trust experience evoked by the designed cover for an
   expensive ship component placed outside.

Analyzing Pride-Related Experience Goals Against Two Dimensions of Pride

   Each goal was then postulated to fall into the category either
   long-term or short-term experience. Two researchers (the authors)
   conducted the goal categorization independently, resulting to an
   inter-rater agreement of 87.88 %. Consensus was reached by discussion.
   These pride-related experience goals were also categorized along the
   self-focus or other-focus dimension. The inter-rater agreement in this
   case was 72.73 %, and the consensus was reached by discussion.

   Combining the two categorizations, each selected experience goal was
   supposed to belong to one of these four groups: self-focused short-term
   pride, self-focused long-term pride, other-focused short-term pride,
   and other-focused long-term pride. Accordingly, the design strategies
   used by the students for different types of pride were compared within
   and across categories.

Results

   According to the social dimension, 17 out of 33 pride-related
   experience goals are self-focused, whereas the remaining 16 goals are
   other-focused. Along the temporal dimension, 15 out of 33 pride-related
   experience goals are short-term, and the rest are long-term. The
   experience goals for self-focus short-term pride and other-focus
   long-term pride both take one-third of all the pride-related experience
   goals whereas other-focus short-term pride was the least designed for.

   As shown in Fig. 6, different design strategies are summarized and
   grouped along the social and temporal dimensions of pride.

Design for Self-Focus Short-Term Pride

   10 out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are both self-focus and
   short-term. The design strategies are distilled into three aspects:
   enhancing self-respect, enhancing self-efficacy, and promoting one’s
   goal achievement.
--
Enhancing Self-Respect

   Three experience goals indicate that enhancing the feeling of
   self-respect is a pathway to pride experience. Thus, providing users
   with a distinctive interactive tool or workspace and strengthening
   their unique expertise may increase self-awareness of users’ own
   professionalism, which leads to self-respect enhancement. For instance,
--
Enhancing Self-Efficacy

   Five experience goals suggest that evoking the feeling of control,
   improvement, and autonomy can enable momentary pride experience. For
   example, providing an overview of all the machines’ data may enhance a
   manager’s feeling of control; boosting performances with a new
   application may enhance a worker’s feeling of competence; providing
--
Promoting One’s Goal Achievement

   Two experience goals indicate goal achievement promotion may induce
   anticipatory pride. For example, rewarding a learner’s practice of
   welding with a tangible certificate and fueling one’s intrinsic
   interest in doing something desirable may be a pathway to pride
   promotion.

Design for Self-Focus Long-Term Pride

   Seven out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are designed for
   self-focused long-term pride. They stress three aspects: fostering
   self-worth, developing one’s competence, and developing and maintaining
   one’s interest.

--
   Three goals indicate that activating one in organizational events,
   letting one work on what one is passionate about, and maintaining a
   positive self-status may foster self-worth, which would thus result in
   a durable self-focused pride. For example, in the case of Konecranes,
   the end users are often invited to a series of organizational events
   that may increase one’s awareness of their own value; making one
   passionate about one's work may result in self-actualization in a
--

   Two goals indicate that challenging one to the next level of skills and
   letting one see how they perform compared to others may produce a
   durable and self-focused pride. In the case of Kemppi, the app provides
   gamification elements and makes the long-term skill improvement
   visible, which may in turn keep learners practicing through enjoyment
   of welding and competition with others.
--

   Two goals from two cases indicate that motivating users with rewards as
   in games and keeping users’ inspirations in a series of organizational
   events may result in self-focus long-term pride. In the case of Kemppi,
   the app keeps an update of unlocked features to encourage learners onto
   the next practice level; a company can hold competitions, workshops,
   and seminars to maintain one’s interest and ambition and can thus
   accumulate one’s long-term pride.

Design for Other-Focus Short-Term Pride

   Five out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are both other-focus
   and short-term. They emphasize two aspects: enabling one’s influence in
   social interaction and evoking a sense of belongingness to an
   organization.
--

   Two experience goals indicate that fueling one’s leadership in social
   interaction and revealing one’s influence on decision-making may result
   in other-focused short-term pride. In the Rolls–Royces case introduced
   above, the special vehicle may guide others’ attention and provide a
   salesperson with a sense of directing, thus facilitate the
   salesperson’s leadership in interacting with the audience. Moreover,
   enabling the customers’ involvement and hence developing awareness of
   their impact on decision-making may build pride in customers through
   social interaction.

Evoking a Sense of Belongingness to an Organization
--
   Three experience goals indicate that facilitating a connection with
   others, sharing happy moments, and stimulating inspiration and
   appreciation from others may lead to the feeling of other-focus
   short-term pride. For example, the output of an interactive system at
   the entrance of the office may evoke employees’ belongingness to a
   company by worldwide company information dissemination and
   entertainment activity arrangement. Besides this, organizational events
   may have the similar impact on stakeholder engagement by stimulating
   their inspiration.

Design for Other-focus Long-Term Pride

   11 out of the 33 experience goals are designed for other-focus
   long-term pride. These goals focus on two main aspects: fostering a
   sense of belonging to an organization and revealing long-term impacts
   of one’s contribution to others.

--
   interaction in organizational events, nurturing organizational
   heritage, and fostering immediate sharing of success may instill a
   sense of belonging to an organization and thus lead to other-focus
   long-term pride. For example, human-to-human interaction at work
   provides the feeling of camaraderie, the appreciation between each
   other, and the historical success of a company, which all contribute to
   collective pride towards an organization.

Revealing the Long-term Impact of One’s Contribution to Others

   Five experience goals indicate that other-focused long-term pride can
   be produced by providing transparency on one's idea development, making
   the positive consequences of one's contributions visible to others, and
   making one’s positive progress visible to others. For example, the
   visualization of a process in which one’s work is further developed and
   implemented by others, and the positive confirmation of one’s critical
   decisions for an organization from a long-term perspective may increase
   one’s stable pride evoked by others.

Discussion

   Workplace as a social space provides a rich context for stimulation,
   development, and maintenance of the dynamics of pride. Design for pride
   in the workplace is a powerful, yet little utilized approach to keeping
   the closed loop of energy up for a successful business. By
   cross-cutting theories from psychology and organizational management,
   this study first introduces the social and temporal dimensions of
   pride. Based on the theoretical framework of pride, the empirical data
   from 20 experience design cases reveals contextualized and concrete
   design strategies for the dynamics of pride experience at work. The
   design implication drawn from these design strategies is given as
   follows.

   The design strategies for self-focused short-term pride is in line with
   the sources of pride in human-production interaction (Desmet 2012):
   self-efficacy enhancement is related to “using the tool induces pride
   of task performance”; self-respect enhancements matches with “owning
   the tool induces pride of one’s expertise”; and goal achievement
   promotion fits with “the tool enables results that induces pride of
   one’s task performance”. To evoke such pride much depends on a
   well-designed momentary interaction between tool and user, for example,
   by measuring and visualizing incremental performance improvement in
   time.

   When moving to a self-focus long-term pride, the design strategies
   adapt to the long-term effect, such as motivation maintenance,
   competence development and fostering self-worth. The key to designing
   for this type of pride is to explore and personalize the individual
   intrinsic meaning and to hold it longer, which is in line with positive
   design for personal significance, i.e., not focusing on the momentary
   effect, but on one’s personal goals and aspirations (Desmet and
   Pohlmeyer 2013).

   Besides the facilitation of work performance enhancement, interactive
   tools can also be designed for other-focused short-term pride to assist
   users’ leadership or involvement in momentary social interaction, such
   as sharing one’s ideas by instant prototyping for collaborative
   discussion. Additionally, seeing others’ responses to one’s
   contribution may happen in organizational events, such as competitions,
   workshops, and seminars. These kinds of events may strengthen one’s
   connection with others, trigger social interaction, and stimulate each
   other’s creativity, in which co-experience of pride can be evoked
   within an organization.

   Other-focused long-term pride is highly related to entrepreneurial
   spirit and loyalty. Company leaders aim to instill such pride into
   their employees and customers. The implications from organizational
   management can enter into design strategy by fostering a sense of
   belonging to an organization through activities (Gouthier and Rhein
   2011). Belongingness is an other-oriented communion, which is about
   sharing common social identity and strengthening interpersonal
   connectedness (Rosso et al. 2010). Thus, sharing a positive identity is
   an important source of the other-focused pride, especially in
   organizational work contexts. Meanwhile, the visualization of progress
   and metrics can enable employees to track their own and others’ work
   (Katzenbach 2003b), and thereby reveal the long-term impact of one’s
   contribution to others, which is also a key design strategy for
   other-focused pride.

   These four types of pride apparently connect to each other and work
   together. For example, one’s pride derived from the pleasure of
   interaction with a work tool may bring out both enjoyment and
   self-enhancement at work. The pleasurable pride may serve as an
   intrinsic motivator for long-term good work performance. The
   visualization of one’s positive work results and progress may evoke
   others’ appreciation. In the long run, the collective impacts of
   everyone’s incremental contribution accumulate and sustain
   organizational success and thereby lead to a durable pride towards
   one’s organization.

   In conclusion, this paper identifies two main trends in designing for
   pride experience in the workplace: designers can uplift their vision
   from self-focused and achievement-oriented interaction with a tool
   towards fostering engagement-oriented interaction with people, and from
   event-based emotional pride in momentary interaction towards a
   long-term organizational attitude of pride. Meanwhile, the role of a
   tool becomes that of an interactive facilitator for co-experience of
   pride in activities rather than the passive means of task completion.

   This study opens the discussion that experience design researchers need
   to study external knowledge in order to broaden the understanding of
--
   between theories and empirical data were born with considerable
   validity which lies in the traceable evidences from available knowledge
   and concrete design cases. On the other hand, however, the predefined
   four-type-pride framework might limit the variety of the strategies,
   because there might be valuable special strategies that could be
   excluded by the scope of this framework. This limitation reflects that
   it could be a danger if designers overly rely on the available
--
   concepts. Moreover, a 2-month project can hardly include a long-term
   evaluation of design results.

   From the finding validity perspective, the pride experience design
   strategies were presented as backup tools in the latest course but
   without guiding the students to use them. Compared with previous cases,
   pride was defined more towards durable pride and organizational pride
   in the recent cases. More importantly, inspired by these cases, the
   companies have gradually changed their mindset from focusing on
   usability towards prioritizing experience, and have recognized pride
   can be designed from not only interaction quality in task but also
   organizational impact. This impact was manifested in the industrial
   seminar when two companies presented and referred the student cases as
   their new path to experience design innovation. At least one
   design-for-pride case was implemented entirely from the students’
   concepts, and got positive feedback from the company’s clients.

   Future studies will focus on at least three directions. First, it is
   worth adding case diversity to the data collection: cases from
   different programs in different research institutes or companies are
   needed for both qualitative and quantitative studies to assess whether
   the two dimensions of design for pride can be applied to a large number
   of design cases. Second, there is a definite need to trace the real
   implementation of certain strategies in the client companies to
   identify the long-term impact on both workers’ subjective wellbeing and
   business development. Third, it is also meaningful to observe designing
   for pride in other domains and to identify what kind of strategies are
   common patterns and to what degree the differences of contexts lead to
   the specificity of design strategies.

   judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial

   “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
   agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
   was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
   heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
   the ball in a hack chaise.”

   “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him.”

   “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend ME so much as pride
   often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that
   so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his
   favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has
   a RIGHT to be proud.”

   “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive HIS
   pride, if he had not mortified MINE.”

   “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
   reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
   ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
   nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
   who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
   quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
   things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be
   proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
   ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”

   motivation that drives the plot.

   Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of
   "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. It
   has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with
   over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in
   modern literature.^[1]^[2] For more than a century, dramatic
   adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of
   Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes
   of the novel, reaching mass audiences.^[3]

       progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of
       Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy

       them both to surrender to their love for each other.

       the family estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, rumoured to be worth
       at least £10,000 a year. While he is handsome, tall, and
       intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and social graces, and so others
       frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof of
       excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the novel,
       he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest. Though he
       appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this
       reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.

   and Prejudice

Major themes[edit]

   Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of
   Pride and Prejudice but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much
   into the title (which was initially First Impressions), because
   commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. "After the
   success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more
--
   the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

   The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the
   other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and
   prejudice."^[9] The phrase "pride and prejudice" had been used over the
   preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison
   and Samuel Johnson.^[10]^[11] Austen probably took her title from a
   passage in Fanny Burney's Cecilia (1782), a popular novel she is known
   to have admired:

     "The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been
     the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. […] if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you
     owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to
     PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination."^[11]^[12]
     (capitalisation as in the original)

   A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and
--
   Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world
   and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr and Mrs Bennet as parents is
   blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be
   principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and
   overbearing.^[13] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and
--
   The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an
   edition of Austen's novel in 1995:

     Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels
     consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that
     teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room
     making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the

Style[edit]

   Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative
   technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as "the free
   representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words
   actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the

   Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first

   Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in
--
   to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it
   is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.^[36]

   She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when
   she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for
   £110^[37] (equivalent to £7,800 in 2021). In renaming the novel, Austen
   probably had in mind the "sufferings and oppositions" summarised in the
   final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called "Pride and Prejudice",
   where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.^[13]

   It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid
   confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of
   First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other
   works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford
   and a comedy by Horace Smith.^[34]

Publication history[edit]

   [220px-Brock_Pride_and_Prejudice.jpg] Title page of a 1907 edition
   illustrated by C. E. Brock

   Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the
--
   subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the
   book.^[39]

   Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three
   hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.^[40] It was advertised in The
   Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.^[33] Favourable reviews saw this
   edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year.
--

   Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French;
   subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and
   Swedish.^[41] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United
   States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.^[38]
   The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series
   in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice,
   first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many
   modern published versions of the novel are based.^[38]

   The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's
   novels. However, whereas her first published novel, Sense and
   Sensibility was presented as being written "by a Lady," Pride and
   Prejudice was attributed to "the Author of Sense and Sensibility". This
   began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit
   anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the
--
   months following publication.^[39] Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be
   the wife of Lord Byron, called it "the fashionable novel".^[39] Noted
   critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he "would rather
   have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the
   Waverley Novels".^[42]

   Charlotte Brontë, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and
   Prejudice was a disappointment, "a carefully fenced, highly cultivated
   garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open
   country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck".^[42]^[43]

   Austen for her part thought the "playfulness and epigrammaticism" of
   Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her
   sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked "shade" and should have
   had a chapter "of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected
   with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the
   history of Buonaparté".^[44]

   Walter Scott wrote in his journal, "Read again and for the third time
   at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and
   Prejudice."^[45]

20th century[edit]
--

   The American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the
   criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.^[46] One
   critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the "romantic conclusion" of Pride and
   Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the
   "individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and
   the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic
--
   wrote the "outrageous unconventionality" of Elizabeth Bennet was in
   Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship
   that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the
   1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.^[46]

21st century[edit]

     * In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the "UK's Best-Loved Book" in
       which Pride and Prejudice came second, behind The Lord of the
       Rings.^[47]
     * In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and
       Prejudice came first in a list of the 101 best books ever
       written.^[48]
     * The 200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice on 28 January 2013 was
       celebrated around the globe by media networks such as the
       Huffington Post, The New York Times, and The Daily Telegraph, among
       others.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

Film, television and theatre[edit]

   Numerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularising Pride and
   Prejudice.^[56]

   The first television adaptation of the novel, written by Michael Barry,

   Hermione Gingold.^[59] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by
   Bernard J. Taylor, with Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet
   and Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy.^[60] A new stage production,
   Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in
   concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell
   as Darcy.^[61] The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera
   Stolthet och fördom on Pride and Prejudice.^[62] Works inspired by the
   book include Bride and Prejudice and Trishna (1985 Hindi TV series).

   Fire Island is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines
   Pride and Prejudice as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay
   vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie "as an
   unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen's Pride and
   Prejudice."^[70] The movie was released in June 2022 and features a
   main cast of Asian-American actors.

Historical Context of Pride and Prejudice

   home, Great Britain combined with Ireland to become the United Kingdom,

   London town homes whose social and political connections bought them
   seats in Parliament or influence in the royal court.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the Bennets are, like Jane Austen herself,
   members of an educated upper middle class known as the “gentry” or the
   “landed gentry.” Considered socially eligible to mix with the
   landowning aristocracy, but quite a step beneath them in wealth,

       Believers may not often realize it, we are either centered on man
       or centered on God. There is no alternative. Either God is the
       center and we have become rightly adjusted to him, or we are the
       center and everything revolves around us. How is power of pride
       broken?
       There are basically two types of evil on this earth - natural evils
       which include earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, flash floods, etc.

Those Feelings Of Pride Series

       God has given us the ability to feel the emotion of pride so that
       we can benefit from good pride and avoid the destructive nature of
       bad pride. It is important to know the difference between the two
       kinds of pride.
       A. Once there was a guy named Zeke who had so much pride he could
       never admit he was wrong. 1. One day Zeke wandered into the
       blacksmith shop with sawdust all over the floor. 2. A few minutes

Ambassador Gutmann's Opening Statement for Pride Day Panel 2023

   AMB Gutmann delivering remarks in chancery courtyard Today we have
   invited you all to join us in honoring the contributions of the LGBTQ+
   communities in both Germany and the United States, to celebrate their
   legacy, and to chart an inspiring course — “toward a more perfect
   union” — for the future.  That is what Pride Month is all about –
   taking stock of the past to prepare us for a more inclusive, just, and
   joyful future.

   Speaking of more inclusive, just, and joyful: This year, President
   Biden hosted the largest Pride celebration in White House history with
   LGBTQ+ families from across the country.

   And here at the Embassy and at our five Consulates, the past 12 months
   have been Pride Year.

   Last summer, we rolled out a series of Pride events to promote LGBTQIA+
   rights. We followed up throughout the year with multiple programs
   highlighting what together we are doing in the United States and
   Germany to advance equality for the LGBTQIA+ community both at home and
--

   Because both Germany and the United States have played meaningful roles
   in the fight for queer rights, we feel a special and joyful duty to
   celebrate Pride. We will avidly advocate for LGBTQI+ rights as often as
   possible right here at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.

   Let us celebrate the transatlantic struggle for queer rights. Germany
   named its pride celebrations after a street in New York City.
   Christopher Street was the site of a despicable police raid and the
   courage to resist that oppression – and persist. Stonewall was a
   milestone in the American civil rights movement and it launched a
--
   ongoing discrimination is serious work.

   This evening, we could not be prouder than to continue our tradition of
   Pride programs in welcoming Germany’s anti-discrimination commissioner,
   Ferda Ataman.

   We know that history doesn’t just travel forward.  Advancing the gains
--
   rights of all people, everywhere. Let me propose a heartfelt toast: To
   a more LGBTQ plus perfect world!

     Amazing night celebrating #PrideMonth at the @usbotschaft with
     LGBTQIA+ friends. Let us be crystal clear: Queer rights are human

Captains Announced For Pride

   Hempstead, NY - Hofstra University Head Women's Tennis Coach Tripp Tuff

   captains for the Pride during their 2024 season.
   Earning this incredible leadership role are: Kaitlyn Ferguson, Deniz

   But the political environment in the US is shifting. Republican state
   legislatures are passing laws restricting LGBTQ+ rights and
   conservative media personalities are demonizing trans people. Some
   companies have faced a rightwing backlash over recent Pride promotions.
   After a promotional campaign with Dylan Mulvaney, a trans influencer,
   sparked a boycott of Bud Light, its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, put
   executives on leave and distanced itself from its own campaign. And
   last month, Target pulled some Pride-themed products off its shelves,
   saying customers had been threatening employees.

   Will pressure from the right cause prominent US companies to back down,
   despite track records of support for Pride? Some brands have maintained
   a strong commitment to visibly supporting the cause, but others are
   celebrating more quietly than last year – for instance, sponsoring
   parades but ignoring Pride on their social media accounts. Here’s what
   we know about their plans for 2023.

Adidas

   The company has already taken heat from the right this year over its
   choice of model for a traditionally feminine swimsuit. The swimsuit is
   included in the company’s 2023 Pride collection, in conjunction with
   the queer South African designer Rich Mnisi. Despite some furious
   anti-trans statements and calls for a boycott, the company has
   continued to promote the swimwear and, in a statement to USA Today,
   defended “a diverse line of models who bring the spirit of this
   collection to life”.

Amazon

   The e-commerce site has participated in parades and concerts for Pride
   month. Last year, however, the Pride parade in its home town of Seattle
   cut ties over Amazon’s donations to politicians who have backed
   anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, according to Seattle Pride. The organization
   also opposed what it described as Amazon’s offer of $100,000 to get the
   parade named after itself. In response to a Guardian inquiry, the
   company said it had “nothing to share” on its plans for this year,
   though it is listed as a parade sponsor. Last year it posted Pride
   content on Instagram throughout the month of June. This year, as of 7
   June, the company has no posts about Pride on its grid (although
   smaller accounts like Amazon Music have been posting Pride content).

Anheuser-Busch

--
   agency, and a pair of executives were put on leave in late April. In
   past years, Anheuser-Busch has touted its support for LGBTQ+
   communities, partnering with LGBTQ+-owned businesses and promoting a
   rainbow-colored bottle. This year the company has yet to mention Pride
   on either the Budweiser or Bud Light Twitter accounts or Instagram
   grids. The company did not respond to a Guardian request for comment on
   its plans for Pride month, but it does appear to be quietly sponsoring
   some parades this year. It has also donated $200,000 to the National
   LGBT Chamber of Commerce amid criticism over its response to the
   boycott.
--
Apple

   The tech company, which has had a robust presence at its local San
   Francisco Pride parade, also works with a number of LGBTQ+
   organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Center
   for Transgender Equality and the Trevor Project. For 2023, it is
   promoting a Pride-themed band for the Apple Watch, continuing a
   tradition of using Pride colors on the device that began in 2016 and
   was expanded with additional colors in 2021 to represent Black, Latino,
   trans and non-binary people.

Bank of America

   The bank’s website has a detailed accounting of its support for LGBTQ+
   rights, and it has sponsored several major Pride parades in the past.
   It continues with parade sponsorships this year and celebrated 1 June
   on Instagram.

Coca-Cola

   The beverage company has sponsored major Pride parades and it continues
   to sell Pride-themed merchandise. It did not respond to a Guardian
   request for comment on its plans for this year, but it is listed as a
   sponsor of several parades.

Dick’s Sporting Goods

   The Pennsylvania-based retailer appears to have big plans for Pride
   2023, with a list of parades on its site. It’s also promoting a broad
   collection of Pride items.

Disney

   kindergarten to third grade. The company is also involved in a legal
   battle over control of its self-governing district, which the state
   sought to take over last year following Disney’s opposition to the
   “don’t say gay” measure. This year, it has a new Pride apparel
   collection and is planning two “Disneyland After Dark” Pride nights for
   the first time in June.

Google

   The tech company has held “virtual Pride parades”, which use
   smartphones and headsets to allow anyone to join a parade from wherever
   they are. It has also participated in and sponsored real-life ones,
   including this year. On 1 June, the main search site marked Pride with
   an article describing how the company is celebrating Pride, including
   highlighting certain apps and LGBTQ+ creators on YouTube.

JPMorgan Chase

   The bank describes itself as a longstanding supporter of the community,
   providing large donations to pro-LGBTQ+ causes, sponsoring Pride

Kohl’s

   The department store is promoting Pride-themed clothing collections –
   and now faces a boycott akin to the backlash against Target, with
   opponents tweeting their fury about “Pride merch for babies”. Kohl’s
   did not reply to a request for comment, but as of Wednesday the items
   appeared to remain available, and on 1 June the company marked Pride
   month on its site and social media. Last year, Kohl’s was a “gold”
   level sponsor of the Pride parade in Milwaukee, where it is based, for
   the first time. It remains a gold sponsor this year.

Levi Strauss &amp; Co

   The San Francisco-based clothing company, which has participated in the
   city’s parade, has launched a Pride campaign and apparel line for this
   year. Asked whether rightwing pressure on other companies would affect
   the outfitter, a spokesperson said Levi’s was “continuing with its
   Pride collection and marketing as planned”.

Los Angeles Dodgers

--
   Republican senator Marco Rubio accused the group of being
   anti-Christian, the team rescinded its invitation – only to re-invite
   them amid anger from LGBTQ+ rights groups. The team apologized for the
   disinvitation. On 1 June, it marked Pride month on Instagram.

Mars

--

   The makeup company is also dealing with calls for a boycott for working
   with Mulvaney, after she posted a video of herself using its products.
   The website of its parent company, L’Oréal, lists Pride plans and
   affiliations involving a number of its brands, including parade
   participation and partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations. Maybelline
   itself featured drag performers on its Instagram to celebrate 1 June.
--

   The fast-food chain has participated in various LGBTQ+-themed
   promotions, including fries with a rainbow box. This year, it will
   sponsor several Pride parades, including in Los Angeles and Dallas.

Miller Lite

   The Bud Light rival has a long history of support for LGBTQ+ causes and
   appears to be continuing with it this year. It touts “town halls” in
   various cities where bars serving the beer can work toward inclusivity
   and sponsors events including the Dallas Pride Miller Lite music
   festival. In a statement to the Guardian, Miller’s parent company,
   Molson Coors, said: “Everyone deserves to feel comfortable having a
   drink and being themselves. That’s why beer, wine and spirits companies
   like ours have supported Pride for decades, why we’ll do so in 2023 and
   why we’ll continue to do so for decades to come.”

NHL

   Hockey teams have attempted to hold a number of Pride nights this year,
   only to see many players refuse to don Pride-themed jerseys. (In some
   cases, they may have had legal concerns given Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+
   laws; 5% of the league’s players are Russian.) Last year, the league
   promoted Pride month celebrations; its plans for this year are unclear.
   As of 7 June, it had not tweeted about Pride; last year, it posted to
   celebrate on 1 June.

Nike

   The athletic brand is continuing its Be True collection to mark Pride
   month.

North Face
--
   Like Adidas, the North Face is dealing with conservative calls for a
   boycott, led by the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. In
   this case, the anger followed an ad campaign featuring the drag queen
   Pattie Gonia for the brand’s Summer of Pride campaign, featuring
   outdoor workshops, as well as its collection of Pride merchandise. The
   company defended the campaign in a statement to Fox News, saying it has
   “always believed the outdoors should be a welcoming, equitable and safe
   place for all. We are honored and grateful to support partners like

PepsiCo

   The beverage company has continued to broadcast its support for Pride
   online this year and is sponsoring the New York City Pride parade.

Starbucks

   The coffee company highlights its work on behalf of LGBTQ+ rights
   extensively on its website, including a timeline of its “history of
   inclusion”. This year, it is sponsoring Pride parades including in Los
   Angeles and San Diego. Meanwhile, it’s facing boycott calls after
   airing an ad in India celebrating a young person’s transition. In a
   statement to the Guardian, the company said it “unequivocally

Target

   The big-box retailer is offering an extensive Pride-themed apparel
   collection, but it has removed some items, citing threats to its
   employees. Experts have warned that the company’s decision could
   “embolden alt-right actors”, encouraging them to believe that threats
   and boycotts are effective. As of 1 June, it was promoting the Pride
   collection prominently on its website.

Donald Trump
--
   The former president offered an array of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise in
   2019, even as he barred trans troops from serving openly and sought to
   support companies seeking to skirt anti-discrimination laws. Believe it
   or not, this year there is no Pride merch available on his campaign
   site.

Walmart

   Despite threats to its big-box competitor Target, Walmart says it is
   not changing its own Pride collection: “We have merchandise that we
   sell all year that supports different groups.” The company, which also
   promoted Pride month on its site and social media, says it has not
   faced threats of its own.

Wells Fargo

   The bank proclaims its support for LGBTQ+ rights, calling itself an
   early leader in the movement. This year, it will “continue to honor and
   celebrate Pride Month by supporting local LGBTQ+ organizations in
   several cities across the country and hosting employee celebrations”,
   it said in a statement to the Guardian.

   Every time someone ripped down the rainbow Pride flag from the Mag.Pi

   one.

   Ms. Carleton, 66, did not waver in her support of L.G.B.T.Q. people.

   The man, whom the police on Monday identified as Travis Ikeguchi, 27,

Republican attorneys general issue warning letter to Target about Pride

   Target pulls some LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise after backlash 06:18

   Seven U.S. state attorneys general sent a letter to Target on Wednesday
   warning that clothes and merchandise sold as part of the company's
   Pride month campaigns might violate their state's child protection
   laws.

   Republican attorneys general from Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky,
   Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina signed the letter, writing
   that they were "concerned by recent events involving the company's
   'Pride' campaign."

   The attorneys said that they believed the campaign was a "comprehensive
   effort to promote gender and sexual identity among children,"
--
   should not tell parents about a child's gender or sexual orientation
   without consulting the child first, something the attorneys general
   said undermines "parents' constitutional and statutory rights."

   The letter did not include any specific demands nor did it outline how
   they believe the campaign could violate child protection laws, but the
   attorneys general did suggest that Target might find it "more
   profitable to sell the type of Pride that enshrines the love of the
   United States."

   The attorneys general also said they believed Target's Pride campaign
   threatened their financial interests, writing that Target leadership
   has a "fiduciary duty to our States as shareholders in the company" and
   suggesting that company officials "may be negligent" in promoting the
--
   to some backlash among customers.

   Target shares have declined 12% this year, but the company is facing
   issues far beyond the backlash to its Pride collection, which included
   onesies, bibs, and T-shirts for babies and children. Like many
   retailers, the company is struggling with a pullback in consumer
   spending because of high inflation, which has weighed on its profits.

   But Target is also facing scrutiny for its merchandise selection,
   including its Pride line, with its stores removing some of the items in
   May after facing threats. At the time, the company didn't specify which
   products were being removed, although Target has faced criticism online
   over swimsuits advertised as "tuck-friendly" with "extra crotch
   coverage" in its Pride collection.

   "Target's management has no duty to fill stores with objectionable
   goods, let alone endorse or feature them in attention-grabbing displays
--
   shareholders to prudently manage the company and act loyally in the
   company's best interests."

   Backlash to the Pride campaign did involve threats of violence to
   Target stores and workers. Some merchandise was relocated to less
   popular areas of the store, and other pieces, including the swimsuits
   criticized by the attorneys general, were removed.

   can be motivating towards action.

   When people are proud of where they live, they help take care of it.

   The Minneapolis Institute of Art offers a variety of events to bring
   Pride to museumgoers. Festivities kick off on 2 June with a gathering
   in the park capped off by a screening of Kiki, seen by many critics as
   a sequel of sorts to the landmark documentary Paris Is Burning, updated
   for an era of Black Lives Matter and renewed focus on trans rights.
   Another must-see event is the 22 June Pride Panel and Activations,

   intersection of their artistic practices and queer identities.

The meaning of Pride

   Fifty-four years ago, something important happened that changed the way
   people think about LGBTQIA+ rights. It started at the Stonewall Inn in
--
   years after the riots, she helped create organizations and policies
   that support LGBTQIA+ rights.

   Today, we celebrate this movement every June during Pride Month. Pride
   is not just about parades and celebrations. It's about recognizing the
   power and resilience of the LGBTQIA+ community. Pride is about family,
   community, accepting ourselves, being visible and embracing who we are.
   It reminds us that everyone has the right to be themselves and be
   treated with respect.
--
   to our workspaces, enables us to ask important questions, speak up and
   make positive changes.

   Pride encourages us to break free from the stereotypes and biases that
   limit us. It reminds us that our identities are complex and should be
   celebrated. Sometimes society tries to make us fit into one narrow box,
   but Pride encourages us to be who we are meant to be — not just survive
   but thrive.

   Pride is for everyone, not just LGBTQIA+ individuals. Stretch yourself
   to come together, support one another and work towards a world where
   everyone is treated equally. How can you do this in your space and
   place of work? While we should practice LGBTQIA+ inclusion throughout
   the year, June offers many opportunities at Pitt and in the region to
   get involved and show support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

15 Subtle Signs of Pride In Your Life

   How do you measure pride in your life? This article provide 15 not so
   obvious ways to assess the level of pride present in our lives.

   I STRUGGLE WITH PRIDE! There, I said it! Many of us would like to think
   of ourselves as humble individuals. But the more you walk with Jesus
   the more He shows you the areas you need to grow in. You might be
   surprised to know that there are many ways that pride can creep into
   our lives and I want to caution us all to be on guard against these. I
   think it’s safe to say that God HATES pride because it reminds Him of
   the original sin in heaven when Lucifer sinned and became Satan (Eze.
   28:12-15; Isa. 14:12-15; Rev. 12:1-3). The following is a checklist of
   15 indicators as to how pride can manifest itself in our lives. As you
   read this I encourage you to take an honest assessment as to whether
   these actions or mentalities are consistently manifested in your life.
   Here we go!
--
#1 – Assuming you already know something when someone is teaching

   When you immediately tune someone out who starts teaching you something
   that you may be somewhat familiar with, that is an example of pride. It
   is the assumption that you know everything about the subject being
   communicated and that this person, whom you see as inferior in
   knowledge to you, cannot teach you something new.
--

   When someone asks you to do something and your immediate thought is,
   “I, out of all people, shouldn’t have to do that. That task is for
   someone else.” That is a sign of pride that we should consider dealing
   with. Next time this thought arises ask yourself,

     If Jesus was willing to leave heaven and come to earth for me, then
--
   There is something to be said for independence. However, there are
   times in life when we must all admit that something is beyond our
   capacity and that we need help. The unwillingness to recognize our own
   shortcomings and need for help is a sign of pride.


#4 – Feeling the Need to Consistently Teach People Things
--
   Have you ever been in a group where someone feels the needs to dominate
   the conversation and seemingly spill everything they know without
   giving other people the opportunity to share? Sometimes this can be a
   sign of pride because when a person knows something that they know most
   other people don’t know much about, it creates a sense of pride within
   them.


#5 – Talking about Yourself a Lot

   When you talk a lot about your accomplishments, your education, title,
   position, and/or financial status, that is a sign of pride. The Bible
   says, “Be quick to listen and slow to speak…” (James 1:19). When we
   talk about ourselves a lot it reveals that we have not yet learned how
   to come up out of ourselves and focus on the interests of others (Phil.
--
   This is when we tend to put others down often because there is a
   deep-seated need for us to feel better about ourselves. People who are
   critical are that way because they secretly see themselves as exempt
   from the very same things they criticize others. This is pride.


#9 – Consistent need for Attention and Affirmation
--
   When someone constantly needs to be the center of attention in public
   or secretly craves consistent affirmation for their accomplishments,
   looks, personality, serving, intelligence, and/or physique, this is a
   sign of pride.


#10 – Unable to receive constructive criticism

   When a person struggles to allow other people to speak into their lives
   and provide helpful feedback it is a sign of pride because they are too
   blinded by their own pride to see the value in what someone is sharing
   with them and how it can help make them a better person.


--
   person is constantly obsessed with how they look and they like to
   flaunt their figure/physique in front of others with the hopes that
   people will notice and gawk at them, this is vanity which is yet
   another form of pride.


#12 – Unwilling to submit to authority
--
   When you consistently associate yourself with people who have prominent
   positions and publicly drop it in conversations in hopes that people
   will think you are equally as important as the people you associate
   yourself with, this is a very subtle form of pride.


SUMMARY

   Whew! So, as you can see pride is something that can creep into your
   life in various subtle ways. A great story in the Bible to study about
   pride is about a man named King Uzziah in 2 Chronicles 26. I encourage
   you read/study it in its entirety. Once again, I encourage you to check
   your heart against this list and ask God to help you identify some ways
   that you struggle with pride and how you can exhibit more humility in
   your life.

The Secretly Prideful Person
                           By Ronald McDonald
                           A friend told me the other day that I’m a very
                           prideful man, and I said to myself, "Dude's
                           just jealous". So I told my wife what he said
                           and she said, "Ah, come on. You're a humble
                           man. Seriously. You're not cocky and flashy and
                           arrogant and all that." But later that same
                           week, I was reading a book that said the most
                           prideful people aren’t usually the bragging
                           arrogant types. They’re the nice friendly
                           helpful ones at work.
                           That got me to thinking that maybe my
                           definition of pride wasn’t very complete. Now I
                           really wondered, What are examples of
                           pride? So, I googled “Signs of pride list” and
                           “Spiritual pride” and couldn’t believe what I
                           found. I was all over the list. I read about 40
                           articles and lists written by well-known
                           psychologists, theologians, pastors and even
                           the Wikipedia entry and consolidated them all
                           here. I put them into 4 groups; Pride of
                           Spirituality, Pride of Knowledge, Pride
                           of Power and Pride of Appearance. So I went
                           back to my wife and said, "Hey honey, I think I
                           found out the root of all of our problems in
                           marriage and work and ministry and all that.
                           ME!!! I'm the problem. Listen to this list of
                           signs of pride that I found." I started reading
                           my list to her and she laughed and said, "Wow!
                           You are prideful. I didn't know that's what
                           pride looked like." So I asked her to pray for
                           me. And then said, "Oh, and there were some
                           other signs that I found on the list." Her jaw
                           dropped as I read hers. She said, "Oh no! I
                           didn't realize I was so prideful either. Will
                           you pray for me too?"
                           God had been resisting me. It was like his palm
                           was firmly planted in my forehead as I walked

                           unmerited favor) to the humble. Could it be
                           that God is resisting you in your relationships
                           or business or church or whatever area of your
                           life? Only by pride comes contention.
                           There are about 24 different categories one
                           could be prideful in. Most people are pretty
                           humble in most categories and just prideful in
                           one or two. You’ll see your relatives, spouse,
                           boss, employees, friends and president all over
                           this list. But don't forget this. Pride is one
                           of the most destructive and heinous sins you
                           can commit.
                           My dad used to say, “The reason we shouldn’t
--
                           should try not to sin because it hurts our
                           relationship with God.
                           Ever heard this? “Yeah, maybe I’ve got a little
                           pride. But if you want to get along with me
                           you’ve just got to grow a pair. It’s just the
                           way I am and you’ll just have to deal with it”.
                           For you to know you have even a little bit
                           of pride and not care about it, is to raise
                           your fist in God’s face and say, “Hey God, I
                           don’t care that I’m regularly walking and
                           living in this sin of pride and I’m okay with
                           not having all that great of a relationship
                           with you either”. If that’s you, then watch
                           out. God is resisting you and you have some

                           thing.
                           We’ll never conquer pride, but if we know what
                           it looks like when it flares up, we can knock
                           it back down before too much damage is done. If
                           people can’t recognize what the signs of cancer
                           look like, then they'll never know they need
                           help. I hope this list helps you understand
                           what pride looks like as much as it's helped
                           me.

How They Define Pride
                           Our SELF or Ego is basically who we are as a
                           person. It’s not good or bad, it’s just what
                           makes us, us. Unhealthy pride happens when we
                           do or say things for the purpose of people
                           praising our SELF or for making our SELF feel
                           good or putting our SELF ahead of someone
                           else's SELF. Pride wants our SELF to be
                           praised, get glory, be worshiped and be highly
                           talked about, even when we’re not in the room.
                           Unhealthy pride can give us an elevated view of
                           our own SELF that is not accurate, but we truly
                           start to believe it and act to reinforce what
                           we've come to believe as true. And when someone
                           questions or challenges the view of our SELF as
                           not accurate, the fireworks begin.
                           Here are some of the definitions of pride I
                           found
                              - Pride is being SELF-ish
                              - Thinking excessively about SELF
                              - Pride’s base is too much SELF-love
                              - Thinking the worth of our SELF is higher
                                than it actually is
                              - SELF-worship
                              - Preoccupation with our image or SELF
                              - Pride is narcissism (in love with our
                                image or SELF)
                              - Pride is SELF-centered or EGO-centric
                                (everything revolves around us)
                              - Pride wants to keep the focus on SELF
                              - SELF-ness
                           "Satan disguises submission to himself under
                           the ruse of personal autonomy. He never asks us
--
                           of sin." - Dennis F. Kinlaw (1922 - 2017)
                           “Instead of being motivated by SELF-ish
                           ambition or vanity, each of you should, in
                           humility (THE OPPOSITE OF PRIDE OR SELF-ISH),
                           be moved to treat one another as more important
                           than your SELF. Each should be concerned not
                           only about your own interests, but about the
--
                           envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed
                           up. It is not rude, it is not SELF-serving, it
                           is not easily angered or resentful." (All
                           the negatives are symptoms of pride) I

                           The same list of examples of what pride looks
                           like, is here twice, one after the other. The
                           first list immediately below does not have much
                           explanation attached to the signs of pride.
                           Further down the page is the same list, but
                           with a much fuller explanation of each sign of

                           “pride defensiveness” or "pride depression” or
                           “pride low self esteem” or “pride critical” to
                           learn why so many people consider it a sign of
                           pride. But be careful not to judge a person's
                           heart because of their actions or words. You
                           can't always tell. A friend of mine, who is a
                           huge servant and genuinely humble, told me that

                           they think I'm humble". Don't try to play God
                           and judge the heart.

Pride of Spirituality
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re spiritual
                           Asceticism - They reject money, pleasure, joy,

                                absolutely have no intention of praying
                                for it. But it sounds spiritual for sure.
                           False Humility - Humility is seeing yourself
                           and what you do the way it actually is. Pride
                           is not seeing yourself or what you do the way
                           it actually is.
                             1. Don’t accept compliments, but instead say,

                             3. Tell you that they’re humble, “In my
                                humble opinion”

Pride of Knowledge
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re smart

                                political beliefs
                           Defensive when corrected or criticized - If you
                           ever get defensive in marriage, then you have
                           pride and it has to be dealt with. We think the
                           best defense is a great offense when our pride
                           is hurt. “With pride comes only
                           contention...”Proverbs‬ ‭13:10
                             1. Attack back when questioned or confronted
                                about a mistake or wrong
--
                             5. Don’t show much mercy
                             6. Mean spirited

Pride of Power
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re capable. “But once he became powerful,
                           his pride destroyed him. He disobeyed the LORD
                           his God...” ‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭26:16‬
                           Controlling - Being obeyed gives their SELF a
                           nice feeling, sense of power

                                SELF feeling good
                           Low SELF-esteem or SELF-worth - Humility is
                           seeing your own SELF the way it actually is.
                           Pride is not seeing your own SELF the way it
                           actually is
                             1. Constantly thinking of their SELF and what
                                others think about it

                           Depression - There are a lot of legitimate
                           medical and traumatic reasons for depression.
                           Focus on SELF and believing what’s not true
                           about their SELF is a very common one. Pride is
                           a major cause of depression for hundreds of
                           millions of people (much more about why this is
                           here, on the second list)

Pride of Appearance
                           Try really hard to impress people with their
                           looks or physique - Synonyms - Narcissistic,

                           Two things to remember:
                           1. Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just
                           reporting the facts, ma'am. These signs of
                           pride are what I found and copied down and
                           then consolidated here for your reading
                           pleasure. Most were on several of the lists.
                           2. If you only saw your SELF in a couple of
                           places on this list, then you just have a
                           little bit of cancer. You need to be desperate
                           for treatment. Everyone is infected with Pride.
                           Don't be okay with it. This is serious.
                            “But then Hezekiah and the residents of
                           Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned
                           their pride, and the LORD was not angry with
                           them for the rest of Hezekiah’s reign." ‭‭2
                           Chronicles‬ ‭32:26
                           “if my people who are called by my name humble

                           said, “repentant or remorseful”. When my wife
                           and I read the list and saw ourselves on it in
                           some places, we immediately pleaded with God to
                           help us keep our pride down and be more humble.
                           We don’t want it at all and we are really sorry
                           that we have been so prideful for so long. And
                           now we question ourselves all the time, “Is
                           what I’m about to say or what I just said,
                           prideful? Because we really don’t want to be
                           prideful, even though we still act pridefully.
                           But a lot less. This is exactly what God wants
                           from us. A humble spirit and a contrite heart.
                           "For thus says the High and Lofty One Who

Three Pride Illustrations

Fighter in the Ring
                           We are in a fight with Prideman, a 600 lb 1%
                           body fat former Navy Seal, who has us by
                           the ankles slamming us down over and over
                           again. It’s a tag team match and God is
--
                           keep on saying, “No, I’m alright God. I’ve got
                           this, but would you mind helping me by
                           squirting some water in my mouth next time
                           around?” as Prideman keeps slamming us over and
                           over again. There may be 21 of the pride
                           categories where we don’t struggle, but one
                           area where we do. I encourage you to be
                           Humbleman and tag God’s hand to wage war for
                           you in that category. “God, I’m ready for you
                           to fight Prideman instead of me. I can’t do it.
                           You need to take over completely.” That’s what
                           humble people say.
                           My SELF says, “No, I can handle this! I just

                           the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you
                           in due time…" 1 Pet. 5:6

Pride Monster
                           Imagine you’re in a canoe and there is a big
                           pride sea-monster that never stops chasing you
                           and it wants to eat you and it’s coming up and
                           down in the water chasing right behind you. So
                           you paddle like crazy to not get bit. Imagine
                           you paddle super hard for a long time and you
                           get really far ahead of it and so you put down
                           your paddle and kick up your feet and take a
                           break. And that’s when the pride monster
                           catches up to you and bites you hard.

Two Dogs
                           Two hungry dogs and only one dish of food. The
                           dog who eats the most is the one who gets
                           stronger and wins the fight. Pridedog is more
                           aggressive and pushier than Humbledog and so
                           pushes Humbledog out of the way and eats all of
                           the food unless someone purposefully pulls back
                           on Pridedog’s chain. That is when Humbledog
                           eats all of the food and wins. Here are some
                           things you can do to feed Humbledog.

                                did you get interested in that?
                              - Share your pride struggles with people
                                close to you and ask them to pray for you
                                and to tell you when they see your signs
                                of pride.

How Extreme Pride Slips In
                           Particularly for public figures like pastors,
                           CEO’s, singers, athletes, actors and actresses,
                           pride slips in subtly and undetected. And after
                           several years of being innocently complimented
                           and praised, we start believing things about
                           our SELF (ego) that are over-inflated above

How Humility Happens to Hard People
                           They say that pride is the last thing to leave
                           before a lot of people come to Christ. They’re
                           tired of trying to fight it on their own and
                           when they’ve tried everything else and have
                           been humbled, then they turn to God. They say,
                           “God, I’ve got a problem with pride and I’m
                           asking that YOU wage war on it. I’ll stand
                           aside. Please fight it for me.” Until a person

                           I was listening to a non faith based marriage
                           book the other day and the author said that
                           Narcissism and Grandiosity (both forms of
                           pride) are a huge problem in America. A lot of
                           it started in the early 1970’s when personal
                           trainers and tons of self help books became
                           super common.  “You can do it. You’ve got what
                           it takes. You are worth it. There are no
                           losers. We don’t keep score. We don’t give
                           grades. Everybody wins and everybody passes.”
                           We clearly live in a self-centered (prideful)
                           society. So how wouldn’t that not bleed into
                           the church? Most churches rightly have the

False Humility
                           Prideful people fake their humility. They try
                           extra hard to be humble for the purpose of
                           people thinking that they’re humble so they’ll

                                even flow from a genuine desire for
                                humility, but humility is seeing your SELF
                                the way you accurately are. Pride is
                                seeing your SELF NOT the way you actually
                                are.
                              - Treat themselves badly - “I am not worthy”
                                or “I’m a loser”.
                              - Prideful people don’t easily accept
                                compliments. They put one hand in front of
                                you like they’re stopping traffic and with
                                the other they point to the heavens while

                                you. If it had been God, then it would
                                have been WAY better than that”. Their
                                pride wants those watching to say, “Whoa,
                                that guy is humble. He must be really
                                spiritual”. The right response would be to
                                say something that is actually true,

                                “Thank you for the kind words. Mom and Dad
                                made me take lessons for years and
                                years.”
                              - Prideful people skillfully brag in a
                                humble way. “Can you believe how great God
                                is. They asked me to speak at the Prayer
                                Breakfast again.” or “Please pray for my

                                spiritual.
                              - Prideful people tell you they’re humble
                                and say, “In my humble opinion”.
                              - Only confess insignificant sins - Prideful
                                people confess little sins and say things
                                like, “I really struggle with coveting my

                                failings.

Pride of Knowledge
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re smart
                           “The wise person accepts instructions, but the

                           could I learn?” He felt he knew everything
                           already.
                              - Prideful people say they don’t need to be
                                trained or educated because that would
                                mean their SELF wasn’t capable enough to
                                be successful without someone’s help.
                                Prideful people want to say, “I became a
                                successful and accomplished self-made man
                                by myself. I didn’t need anyone to teach
                                me anything because I’m that smart or
                                capable. I’m sure you’re impressed with
                                me”.
                              - Prideful people think they have all the
                                answers to life and somehow don’t need or
                                see the value in other people’s
                                perspectives.
--
                              - Though credentials and titles are
                                sometimes necessary to establish authority
                                so they’ll listen to or negotiate with
                                you, prideful people insist on a lofty
                                title or talk a lot about their
                                credentials so that others will be more
                                impressed and think more highly of them.

                              - Assume they know all there is about the

                              - Don’t listen to those they lead
                              - Prideful people listen to others just to
                                see if they can fix them or bless and
                                impress them with their wisdom and
                                knowledge.

Argumentative
                           Prideful people argue strange, new or
                           uncommonly held beliefs or doctrines and argue
                           them well so that people are impressed with
                           their intellect.
                              - They get the last word
                              - Prideful people don’t discuss their
                                differences with the hope of possibly
                                learning something. They argue to show how
                                much they know.
                              - Prideful people don’t hesitate confronting
                                someone to say what they think is right.
                              - They can’t handle being wrong.
                              - Argue and hold to strange or uncommonly
--
                           Unnecessary criticism is just mean. It tears
                           down, doesn’t help and makes people feel bad.
                           It is usually based in poor self-worth and
                           shame. Prideful people measure themselves
                           against others. When someone near them does a
                           good thing, it makes their SELF feel inferior,
                           and so they tear them down for no reason other

                              - Always give the punishment deserved
                                instead of showing mercy

Pride of Power
                           Thinking that they’re more important than
                           others or trying to make sure people think
                           they’re capable.

Pride and a Controlling Nature
                           Here is a comprehensive article full of
                           psychobabble about why the need to control,
                           feel superior and be mean to others is such a
                           huge sign of
                           pride.http://mindrenewal.us/page6.html

Control
                           Control is trying to give yourself security.
                           But remember, you are one cancer cell away from
                           being in control.
                              - Prideful people control their spouse,
                                children, friends and co-workers.
                              - Prideful parents create dependent children
                                by providing everything for them and not
                                letting them suffer the consequences of
                                their irresponsible actions. They want to
                                keep them around to be needed. A form of
                                control.
                              - Prideful people manipulate to get their
                                way by throwing their wedding ring across
                                the room or throw some sort of tantrum
                                whether it’s really quiet or really loud.
                                They try to condition you to go with their
                                idea everytime.
                              - Prideful people say it’s my way or no way.
                                They threaten to boycott the trip or
                                activity by saying, “Nevermind, I don’t
                                even want to go now” if they don’t get

                           read any version of the Bible other than the
                           King James Version or or…. This form of Pride
                           has kept more people away from God than maybe
                           any other. I know so many people raised in
                           legalistic homes who now, as adults, mock

Submission
                           Prideful people don’t submit easily and rebel
                           against their leaders, spiritual or secular and
                           falsely see it as a weaker position. God as our
                           leader. Wives against their husbands; children

                           humble and listen to those they lead,
                           especially when their initial thought wasn’t as
                           good as someone else’s.
                           Prideful people don’t like being told what to
                           do. This doesn’t mean to not question or share
                           wisdom with our leaders, but without a fight,
                           submit.

Hungry for Attention
                           Prideful people get hurt and resent it if they
                           aren’t made mention of and recognized for their
                           accomplishments, acts of service or
                           selflessness. They say and do things for

                           take great notice of them and regard them

                           there.
                           Prideful people lie. They don’t just embellish
                           a story to make it more entertaining but flat
                           out lie with numbers and circumstances to make
                           their SELF look better.

Take Credit for Things
                              - Prideful people lie to take credit for
                                things they didn’t do.
                              - Prideful people don’t give compliments or
                                credit to people who deserve it because
                                they think it makes them look bad in
                                contrast.
                              - Don’t like to share praise with others
                              - Prideful people don’t need to pray because
                                that would mean God did it and they
                                wouldn’t get credit for it.
                              - Prideful people shoot down other people’s
                                good ideas because it wasn’t their own and
                                even condition others to eventually stop
                                sharing ideas. They make fun of them or

Workaholic
                           Prideful people are serve or work obsessed,
                           addicted to power and control in a compulsive
                           drive to gain approval and public recognition
                           of success. They believe that their SELF or

                              - Prideful people in leadership positions
                                don’t delegate as often as they should
                                because no one can do it as well or as
                                quickly as they could.

Crave Importance
                           Prideful people feel and believe that value is
                           added to their SELF because of their status or
                           accomplishments. They feel that they are worth
                           more by doing or appearing a certain way.

Overachiever Pride

                           True humility isn’t thinking less of your SELF,
                           but thinking of your SELF less. Here is a great
                           psychobabble article about why low self esteem
                           and depression is a huge sign of pride.
                           Humility is seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Knowing what is true about who you
                           are. If you are a naturally gifted musician or
--
                           or don’t have much fashion sense, they are
                           comfortable admitting it because it’s true
                           about their SELF.
                           Pride is NOT seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Not believing what is accurate and
                           true. If you’re a physically attractive person
                           but tell everyone that you’re ugly or if you
                           have a very likable personality but say that
                           people don’t like you, then that is pride
                           because it isn’t true. Prideful people who
                           aren’t very good at coming up with creative
                           marketing ideas or who are clearly not very
                           good at leading people, won’t stop insisting
                           that they are and are offended if someone
                           speaks the truth to them. Prideful people don’t
                           believe what is true about their SELF.
                              - Won’t ask for forgiveness because that
                                would mean that their SELF isn’t great and
--
                                to think highly of them.

Embarrassed easily
                           Embarrassment is a sign that pride is being
                           attacked.
                             1. Prideful people think they’re above doing
                                lowly tasks and immediately think, “I, of
                                all people, shouldn’t have to do that.
                                That task is for someone lower than
                                myself.”
                             2. Prideful people fear people seeing them
                                doing lowly tasks because they fear that
                                others will think they must not be very
                                powerful or important if they have to do a
                                lowly task.
                             3. Prideful people wait to be served and
                                don’t often serve others because they
                                don’t think of others as more important
                                than themselves.
                             4. Prideful people think they’re better than
                                others. This one can be hard to detect
                                because a person can appear to be humble
                                and caring on the outside.
                             5. Prideful people are easily offended when
                                others question their motives or ability
                                to do something. They say, “Don’t you
                                trust me” or “Don’t you think I know what
--
                           their SELF is true. It is especially hard on
                           them when someone who is their equal rises
                           above them economically or in social standing.
                             1. Prideful people believe others are envious
                                of them because “wouldn’t everybody be
                                envious of what I’ve got?”
                             2. Prideful are envious when the spotlight is
                                on someone they feel they are superior to.
                                Then they whisper to the person next to
                                them, “They’re not all that”.
                             3. Prideful people sabotage other people’s
                                work or don’t use someone else’s good idea
                                because they think that if that person is
                                praised, then they will look lesser.

Materialism
                           Prideful people try to impress with their
                           success by showing us their possessions.
                           Prideful people are not generous with their
                           money. They are SELF-ish and would rather use
                           their money to buy things that they feel
                           validate their untrue feelings of who they
--
Defensiveness
                              - Think the best defense is a great offense
                                when their SELF feels attacked (when their
                                pride is hurt).
                              - They condition people to NEVER confront
                                them again by attacking them back with
                                their past mistakes or failures so it
                                takes the focus off of the prideful
                                person’s problem.
                              - Prideful people make up excuses when
                                they’re corrected or criticized.
                              - Prideful people say things like,
                                “Everybody makes mistakes” or “you make
                                mistakes too” when they have no choice but
                                to accept blame.
--
                           There are a lot of legitimate medical and
                           traumatic reasons for depression. Focus on SELF
                           and believing what’s not true about their SELF,
                           is a common reason. Pride is a major cause of
                           depression for millions of people.

Shyness
                           We can be wired as introverts purposefully by
                           God from birth. This isn’t about introverts or
                           extroverts
                              - Prideful people are very shy. They are
                                overly concerned with others’ opinions of
                                them which is usually a reflection of
                                being obsessed with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t invite people to
                                their home because it’s not nice enough or
                                they can’t afford to entertain big.
                              - Prideful people have a hard time sharing
                                their real spiritual needs or other junk
                                because they’re afraid they won’t be liked
                                anymore.
                              - Prideful people fear what people will
                                think of them and are overly consumed with
                                man’s opinion of their SELF which is
                                usually a sign of obsession with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t like reaching out
                                and being friendly at church or in other
                                social settings.

Pride of Appearance
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re valuable and they believe their SELF is
                           more valuable if it looks good
                           Arrogance, Immodesty, Narcissism, Pomposity,
                           Pride, Self-Importance, Self-Love, Self-regard,
                           smugness, swagger, self-admiration,
                           self-exaltation, swelled head, conceited,
                           display, pretension, self-worship, show,
                           ostentation,
                           We should take healthy pride in our appearance
                           and do the best with what we’ve got and for our
                           spouse. Dignity is a good thing. But this is
                           not:

Understanding Why We Have Pride and How it Works
                           God wants us to be proud of our work or family
                           or to try the best with what we’ve got. And
                           when we’re recognized and affirmed for doing
                           well, it feels good and right. That’s healthy
                           pride. The apostle Paul said that he was
                           “proud” of some of the early churches.
                           When we’re supported, protected and affirmed
                           growing up, then that builds a solid firm
--
                           accurate about us. And that’s when the praise
                           and worship of us starts and that makes us
                           think that what we believe about our SELF is
                           true. Pride can even distort our mind to think
                           that even our junk is good and right.

Conclusion
                           I really hope this list and explanation has
                           helped you understand what pride really looks
                           like and has given you a desire to not have it
                           in your life. And remember, don’t shoot the
                           messenger.</text>

11 Signs You Are Prideful

   How do you know you are struggling with pride? What are the symptoms of
   being prideful? To help you answer these questions and get rid of pride
   in your heart, evaluate yourself by checking out the following signs:

1. You think you are humble.

   One of the signs that you are proud of is that you refuse to admit that
   you struggle with pride. Therefore, calling yourself “humble” is
   actually false humility.

   To avoid this, stop telling yourself—or others—that you are humble. If
--
   that everyone adores you. Do not think that you are more important than
   anyone else. Instead, try living a low-key life.

4. You are vain about your physical appearance.

   Being obsessed about making yourself attractive is another hint of
   pride creeping into you. In connection with no. 3, vanity makes you
   flaunt your beauty, hoping that everyone will admire you.

   It is okay to take care of yourself and evaluate your motive for being
   attractive. However, if it is to draw attention to yourself, maybe it
   is time to re-orient yourself about real beauty.

5. You do not like associating with the “ordinary” or unpopular.
--
   to sit with? Do you immediately look for the table where the “elite”
   sit around? If you think you only deserve professionals and
   “first-class” citizens for your friends and avoid hanging out with
   “low-level” people, then you are clearly prideful.

   To get rid of this attitude, be equal in treating people. Make friends
   not according to social status, but the sincerity of individuals
--
7. You are not teachable.

   Not listening to someone who is trying to teach you something is
   another sign of pride. It is either you think you know things already,
   or you think you know more than the person. It could also mean you
   consider him/her inferior to you.

--

8. You do not listen to others’ advice.

   Prideful people are also stubborn. They think they know everything
   already, so they disregard the counsel of others. You are one of them
   if you brush off the advice of your parents, some elders, or anyone
   else.
--
9. You do not like to be surpassed by anyone.

   Considering others as threats to your position, fame, and success is a
   result of pride. Your achievements could have gotten into your head
   already that you think you should always be the no. 1. Thus, when you
   meet people who have the potential to beat your accomplishments, you
   consider them as rivals.
--
10. You think you are too important to do mundane things.

   If you think your position is so high that you cannot pick up trash,
   help clean up, or serve others, that is definitely pride.

   Do not let entitlement make you feel like you are more important than
   anyone else. Great people are not afraid to serve those who are less
   fortunate than them.

11. You are critical to those who do better than you.

   One symptom of pride that you should watch out for is being critical
   towards others, especially those you are insecure with. Pointing out
   their flaws makes you feel better about yourself and better than them.

   Bitterness is the result of pride stepped on. Whenever you feel
   resentment towards someone who did better than you, keep yourself from
   thinking or saying bad comments about the person. Instead, give
   appreciation and be happy for him/her.

Healthy Pride is Good

   Not all pride is bad. It can be good.

   Good pride is a healthy, positive attitude towards ourselves and our
   lives. It does not mean thinking we are better than others or that we
   should be treated differently.

1. Self-confidence is a good pride

   We should be confident, not arrogant. Confident people are realistic.
   They know what they can do well and try to do it often, but they also
   recognize what they cannot do and try to avoid those things.

2. Self-respect is a healthy pride

   This is the most important aspect of healthy pride. We should respect
   ourselves by respecting others. Treating others well helps us feel
   better about ourselves, while ignoring or mistreating others makes us
   feel worse.
--
   have bad habits or skills that we can improve. Self-esteem includes
   recognizing both of these sides to ourselves.

   Healthy pride comes from within: we should be proud of what we
   accomplish without feeling that we deserve special treatment. Healthy
   pride comes from God: when he made us in his image, he gave us value
   and worth; he expects nothing less than excellence from us as well!

5. Optimism
--
   Achieving goals helps us feel more positive about ourselves and feel
   motivated to set new goals because of this success.

6. Those with healthy pride lead, motivate, and inspire others.

   They do not use their success as a way to put others down. On the
   contrary, they want the good of everyone to be achieved and are willing
--

7. Being able to take care of yourself.

   Healthy pride means taking care of yourself and being grateful for the
   opportunities you have been given in life. For instance: being thankful
   for your family, education, job, etc. Having healthy pride means that
   you do not need to compare yourself with others – you are enough on
   your own!

   People with healthy pride can see their own flaws and weaknesses. They
   also have the ability to assess the value of others even more than
   themselves because they have a more realistic view of life.

--
   than just surviving or getting by on a day-to-day basis. In return, we
   may find happiness instead of sorrow when pursuing our ambitions!

What are the characteristics of an prideful person?

1) Being unthankful.

--

3) Being selfish.

   Prideful people think only of themselves and their own needs first, not
   about the needs of others around them who may be suffering. They often
   take advantage of others.

--

4) Being defensive.

   A prideful person doesn’t like to admit that he has faults or
   weaknesses. He is defensive when anyone points them out, so he does not
   improve himself and correct his mistakes. Instead, he often blames
   others for the things that are going wrong with him.
--

5) Refusing to forgive others.

   Prideful people think that any injustice against them must be punished
   severely to feel better about themselves and especially to inflict pain
   on those who hurt them (even if they were the only one who was hurt).

   They focus on their own rights and think they are entitled to get back
   what others have done, or even more.

   Prideful people aren’t willing to forgive others who offend them, no
   matter how repentant they are or how much it would be for the good of
   their relationships if they did so.

--

8) Jealous.

   Prideful people are envious of others and want to tear them down
   because those people have something good that proud people don’t get
   for themselves.

   When someone does something right, a prideful person thinks it is bad
   because it makes him look bad for not doing as well himself. So he gets
   upset at the success of others and tries to make them feel guilty for
   shaming him.

   Likewise, a prideful person feels bitter when someone gets a gift or
   good fortune that he did not receive. He is jealous of what others have
   or do and does not rejoice for them.

--

9) Bullying.

   Prideful people don’t like it when they feel small, so they will bully
   others into making themselves feel bigger. They are overbearing and
   tyrannical with those who don’t think or act as they do to maintain
   their ego.
--
   things can make a person feel superior and treat those who have less
   poorly to make himself feel better about himself.

Why is pride so sinful?

   There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you have achieved. For
   example, a good parent is proud of their child when they do well in
--
   your car, house, or job, and rightly so – they are all achievements
   that deserve to be praised.

   But pride can become a sin when it turns into arrogance.

   The Apostle Paul, who wrote most of the New Testament, was an
   incredible man. He helped change the world with his writing and
--
   this is a humble statement from someone who has done so much for God’s
   kingdom.

   Pride causes us to think that we are better than others or that what we
   do is more important than others. It makes us believe that our
   achievements are entirely our own doing rather than recognizing the
   hand of God along the way. Pride stops us from thanking Him for His
   grace.

   When we are proud of our achievements, it becomes difficult to accept
   criticism or negative feedback because we don’t think we need any help.

   Pride stops us from serving others. When someone is arrogant, they
   think they are better than everyone else – so why serve others? They
   will look down on you for doing menial tasks, whereas if you were
   humble, you would serve others and do menial tasks out of obedience.

   Pride can indeed be a sin when we are proud of our achievements, but it
   can also be a sin when we are proud about who we are rather than what
   we do.

   It’s okay to say ‘I am good at mathematics’ or ‘I am an amazing
   singer,’ but if this becomes more important to us than saying, ‘Jesus
   sacrificed His life for me, and I have come to love Him deeply,’ then
   pride has set in.

   Pride stops us from being thankful for the incredible grace that God
   has given us. When someone is arrogant, they think nothing of thanking
   Jesus for anything – because they consider themselves so great! But if
   you were truly humble, you would be thankful for every blessing that
   comes your way, whether it be something as small as a cup of water or
   something great like the life of Jesus.

What do the Bible verses say about pride?

     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption, and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


     Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
     Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share
     plunder with the proud. (Proverbs 16:18-19, NIV)


     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


--
     (Romans 11:18-20, ESV)


     One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will
     obtain honor. (Proverbs 29:23, ESV)


     When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
     wisdom. (Proverbs 11:2, NIV)


--
     12:16, NLT)


     Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those
     who take advice. (Proverbs 13:10, NIV)


--

Evaluate Your Heart

   Many other things could give you a hint that pride is attacking you.
   The bottom line here is your motivation. If you do things out of
   selfish ambitions, then you are definitely prideful.

   To prevent pride from overcoming you, you must check your motives
   daily. It is important that you keep your feet on the ground, no matter
   how high you have reached already.

   God knows your heart, and if it is full of pride, He might teach you
   some lessons. Remember, the Bible says in Luke 14:11, “For all those
   who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
   will be exalted.”

38 Signs Of Pride In A Person

   Too much pride will cause problems in your relationships, jobs,
   friendships, and ultimately every area of your life. Unfortunately,
   pride makes it hard to grow because the pain inside causes information
   to be filtered wrong and in a way that it doesn’t hurt the ego. Often a
   prideful person doesn’t know how severe their pride is.

   The pride within the person is there to protect their VERY fragile ego.
   For instance, if you point out flawed behavior in a prideful person
   they won’t be able to accept it OR won’t be able to see the truth.
   Especially if that behavior is very embarrassing for them. The fragile
   ego of others will push them to use different types of unhealthy coping
--
   downplaying their own actions, be offended you accused them, and many
   other unhealthy coping mechanisms.

   Unfortunately, many that struggle with pride lack support because
   “pride” and “ego” stop them from asking for help. Or they don’t have
   the right type of support because the pride causes one to avoid/refuse
   to take constructive criticism from anyone. And a prideful person may
   feel afraid of vulnerability or be unwilling to feel inferior to the
   person giving the help.

What causes pride?

   The ultimate cause of pride is trying to fix our low self-esteem,
   unworthiness, and fears in our own strength. Pride damages your career
   and relationships because you are only pretending to be confident,
   strong, and bold.
     * 7 Root Causes of Pride + tips to be more humble:

Why is Pride Such a Big Sin in Islam?

   15 September, 2020
   Q Assalamu alaikum, may Allah's blessings be upon you.My question is
   regarding the idea of pride. I understand that it does not lie in
   honesty and decency for one to have the intention to show off in front
   of another while performing an action, as in this case, it equates to
   the action not being done at all, due to insincerity and impurity of
--
   such intentions.But I would like to know, just to understand this whole
   thing better, why does one attach such ideas and intentions to actions
   that are meant to help us find our own truth? In short, I would like to
   know more about why pride (that leads one to show off) is so sinful and
   wrong , even if it's only a small feeling of it.

Answer

   15 September, 2020

   Short Answer:
     * When pride finds its way into the hearts of Muslims, it quickly
       affects the way we talk, act and treat others. This is why it
       should be avoided and we should stay away from it just like any
       other sin.
--

   Thank you for your question,

Why is Pride Such a Big Sin in Islam?

   Prophet Muhammad said,

--
     arrogance in his/her heart.” (Tirmidhi)

   All human beings have the tendency to become proud but there are
   different degrees of pride. It could be so little that it becomes
   unnoticeable and yet it could grow to be eventually a larger amount.
   That is why we always pray to Allah not to make us among the proud and
   arrogant people.

   Ads by Muslim Ad Network

   Pride brings confusion in the religion of Allah and thus it corrupts
   the heart and prevents it from thinking about over the verses of the
   Quran.

How salah (prayers) curbs pride

   As Muslims, Allah commanded us not to bow before anyone but him. That
   is why performing Salah is very important in Islam because Prophet
--
   before anyone but Him.

   Islam teaches us to be humble to one another. One of the
   characteristics of a good Muslim is humbleness and humility, pride is a
   characteristic of Satan. Pride could make people disobedient towards
   the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

The negative effects of pride

   It is only pride that will make a Muslim not forgive another Muslim,
   when their forgiveness is being asked. Hence, a proud person will start
   thinking that he or she is better than others, forgetting that we were
   all created from clay and we have a grave to go to and Allah to answer
   to.

   Pride causes people not to be content and they are eternally in pursuit
   of power and position. Pride pushes people away from the religion of
   Allah and the curse of Allah is on the proud and arrogant.

     “I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You
     created from clay.”

   Allah Almighty said in Noble Quran about the greatest sin arrogance
   (pride) in these words:

     “[To them] it will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell to abide
     eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant”
     (Quran, 39:72).

   According to the Holy Quran, arrogance (pride) is the sin that will be
   severely punished by Allah Almighty. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad said
   that pride is the disease which is the greatest sin in the sight of
   Allah Almighty; one who is proud is arrogant. People who are arrogant
   will not enter paradise.

   People who live in a state of pride and betrayal reside in a dark
   internal world full of a extreme fear of losing, making a mistake,
   being humiliated, stress, doubt, hatred, anger, and passion.

--
   they never find peace in life. Like sea salt water, the thirst is never
   quenched with it.

   When pride finds its way into the hearts of Muslims, it quickly affects
   the way we talk, act and treat others. This is why it should be avoided
   and we should stay away from it just like any other sin.

Frequently Asked Questions About Pride Month

   Pride Month FAQ Pride Month FAQ

What is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is a time for the LGBT community and allies to come
   together in celebration, solidarity, activism, reflection, and support
   of all LGBTQIA+ people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
   intersex, and asexual).

   While a Pride Parade or Pride March are often part of Pride
   celebrations, there’s more to this holiday than parades! Pride can be a
   meaningful time to learn about the historical and present struggles and
   exclusion of LGBT people.

When is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is celebrated during the month of June. In 2023, Pride
   Month will be June 1-30, 2023.

Where is Pride Month celebrated?

   Pride Month is primarily celebrated in the United States. However, you
   can find Pride Month festivities around the globe – even in areas where
   it is not an officially recognized occasion.

How did Pride begin?

   Pride originated as a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the
   Stonewall Uprising (sometimes called the Stonewall Riots). In the early
   hours of June 28, 1969, police conducted a raid on a gay bar called the
   Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City.
--
   Unfortunately, during this time, being gay was a criminal offense. In
   fact, it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person until 1966. Raids
   on gay bars were standard procedure, but this raid would go down in
   history as the birth of the Pride movement.

   Led by courageous transwomen, people at the Stonewall Inn protested the
   raid, leading to a six-day-long resistance. By just the second evening,
--
   many people became more engaged in activism and advocating for the
   equal treatment for LGBT people.

   The first Pride march was held one year later, on June 28, 1970.

   Learn more about the Stonewall Uprising from the Library of Congress.

Is It Permissible to Have Pride? Is There Such Thing as Good Pride?

   [June 28, 2022] [Shaykh Yusuf Weltch]/in Adab, Living Religion,
   Spirituality
--

Question

   What can we have pride in? Is there a good pride? I heard that we can
   have pride in battle as that gives us more strength or the feeling of
   strength, but my question is, does this mean any battle?

   If I was playing in a sports match could I have pride in myself? Also,
   is there a good type of pride?

Answer

--
   Your question is another reflection of the difficulty and the downside
   of translation from Arabic to English. There are many words in the
   Arabic language that translate into words of similar meaning in
   English. One example of this is the words translated as pride.

   The word Kibr (translated as pride or arrogance) has a very bad
   connotation, whereas, the word Fakhr (translated as pride, also) can
   have a good connotation. Let’s define each as they are understood in
   the Arabic language.

Kibr

   Kibr (pride or arrogance) comes from the word Kabir, meaning to be
   great. Thus this word means the state of a person who deems themselves
   great in comparison to others. This is always a blameworthy
   characteristic for all created beings; this is because only Allah Most
   High is absolutely great: hence the saying Allahu Akbar. [Ghazali, Ihya
   ‘Ulum al-Din]

   To act out one’s pride (kibr), either inwardly or outwardly, is sinful.

Inward Manifestations of Pride

   The inward manifestation of pride is explained in the following
   Prophetic narration:

   The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and give him peace) said,
   “No one who has an atom’s weight of pride (kibr) in their heart will
   enter Paradise.” A man (amongst the Companions) said, “Surely a person
   loves that his clothes look good and that his shoes look good.” The
   Messenger replied, “Indeed, Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride
   (kibr) is to refuse to accept the truth and to look down on people.”
   [Muslim]

Outward Manifestations of Pride

   The outward manifestations of pride are many. Here are some of them:
     * Walking haughtily
     * Allowing their garments to drag on the floor, to show their status
     * Speaking harshly to people
--
   All of the above are prohibited in the Sacred Law. The only exception
   to some of the above is in the context of standing up against
   arrogant/oppressive people. The Great Yahya bin Muadh (Allah be pleased
   with him) said, “Showing pride in the face of a prideful person is
   humility.” i.e. it is warranted in some situations if done with the
   right intention.

25 Important Examples of Pride in the Bible

   Mar 5, 2022Mar 8, 2022 by Editor in Chief

   According to the Bible, pride is when you think too highly of yourself.
   Sinful pride usually involves you thinking and acting in a way that
   shows you think you are better than God and/or the people around you.

   Since not all pride is sin, let’s look at 25 important examples of
   pride in the Bible to learn exactly what sinful pride is so we can
   examine our own pride in our lives.

1. Jesus is Beat and Mocked by the Guards

--
   the Jews!’ And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the
   head.” (Matthew 27:27-30 ESV)

   C.S. Lewis said, “the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride.” We
   see pride, the utmost evil, in action as the guards take the King of
   the Universe, Jesus Christ, and treat Him as if He were no better than
   dirt. They beat and mock Jesus before sending Him to the cross,
   treating Jesus as though He were inferior to them.
--
   Spirit.'” (Acts 8:18-19 ESV)

   Simon saw the Holy Spirit work through the Apostles, and he wanted the
   same gift. In an ultimate act of pride, Simon tried to buy the gift of
   the Holy Spirit with money. He tried to take a gift that came from
   God’s grace and buy it for his prideful pleasure.

4. The Pride in All of Our Hearts

   “Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity,
   to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they
--

   There are points in all of our lives where we sin by doing what God
   does not want us to do.  We choose to use the good things that God has
   given us for selfish pleasure. We are being prideful people by doing
   what we want instead of what the Creator has called us to do.

5. Adam and Eve Eat the Forbidden Fruit
--

   When God made the universe, He gave the first humans, Adam and Eve, one
   rule. That was not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
   and evil. Due to their pride, they thought they knew more than God and
   ate the fruit anyway.

6. Saul Persecutes the Church
--

   Saul, who would later become the apostle Paul, who wrote most of the
   New Testament, persecuted the early church. Before Saul met Jesus, he
   was a prideful person who thought he was better than the Jewish
   Christians. Saul thought he had the right to beat, imprison, and kill
   them.

--
   appearance.” (1 Samuel 17:41-42 ESV)

   The Philistine, who is Goliath, looks at the young man David and thinks
   David is not a worthy opponent to fight. Goliath’s sinful pride only
   allows him to look at the outside of David, not his heart. It is a good
   thing that God judges our hearts and not by our physical appearances.

--
   Nebuchadnezzar has set up.'” (Daniel 3:1&amp;4-5 ESV)

   In the book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar makes a giant gold statue of
   himself and forces everyone to bow to it. The sin of pride is seen here
   by Nebuchadnezzar making much of himself instead of God. Later in the
   book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar’s pride leads to him having a very hard
   time in his life.

9. The Pharisee Judges the Sinner Woman
--
   puts a lovely smelling perfume on Him. The Pharisee, instead of seeing
   a woman who needs the love of Christ Jesus, judges her and sees a woman
   who he thinks is the scum of society (as someone fulfilling mens’ lust
   of the flesh). This prideful person judges the woman because he views
   himself as better than her.

10. The Pride of the Haughty Spirit

   “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”
   (Proverbs 16:18 ESV)

   The book of Proverbs is full of teaching on pride. “Haughty” means that
   you think you are superior or that you have an exalted sense of
   yourself. People who have a haughty spirit are full of pride because
   they believe they are better than those around them.

11. Opposition of the Proud
--
   “But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, ‘God opposes the proud but
   gives grace to the humble.'” (James 4:6 ESV)

   There is such a thing as good pride in the Bible. However, most of the
   time that pride is mentioned in Scripture, it is something we want to
   oppose. Often, people whose life is marked by this pride do not
   understand their need for grace or humility.

12. Judas Sells Jesus for 30 Pieces of Silver
--
   he sought an opportunity to betray him.” (Matthew 26:14-17 ESV)

   Even though Judas traveled with Jesus for three years, hearing Him
   teach God’s word, he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. In a prideful
   moment of defiance, Judas thought he was better than Jesus and was
   willing to trade Jesus to those that wanted to kill Him.

--
   than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but
   the one who humbles himself will be exalted.'” (Luke 18:9-14 ESV)

   Pride can be seen in the Pharisee because he thinks he is better than
   the tax collector because of his good works. However, we see the tax
   collector crying out for God’s mercy because of his sin. Wise men boast
   in the Lord and not the good things they do.

14. Pride in Your Possessions

   “For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires
   of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from
   the world.” (1st John 2:16 ESV)

   The world will teach us to find our worth in what we look like and own.
   However, this is the perspective of the proud person who is of this
   world. We have worth in God because He is the Creator of the world.

15. Pride in the Good Gifts God Has Gave Us

   “Thus says the Lord: “‘Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let
   not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in
--
   the Lord.'” (Jeremiah 9:23-24 ESV)

   It would be easy for us to boast about the things that we are good at
   or have a lot of. However, that comes from pride because everything we
   have comes from God. Instead, we should boast in God because we get
   everything from Him!

16. Pride Prevents Us from Serving Others

   “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count
   others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only
   to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”
   (Philippians 2:3-4 ESV)

   Humility is the exact opposite of pride. Pride tells us to put
   ourselves at the center of the universe. However, humility actually
   calls us to love and serve the people around us by looking out for
   their interests.

17. Hidden Pride in the Disciples

   “An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. But
   Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him
--
   who is least among you all is the one who is great.”‘ (Luke 9:46-48
   ESV)

   People often have pride and do not even know it is hiding in their
   hearts. For example, when the disciples are fighting over who will be
   the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, Jesus shows them that those who
   are greatest have nothing to do with position but has to do with those
   who are willing to serve.

   Jonathan Edwards, who was one of America’s most important theologians
   and died in 1758, wrote an essay called Undetected Spiritual Pride. He
   listed seven sneaky (or subtle) symptoms of pride. They are:
    1. Price: the Great Fault-Finder
          + This is when we criticize other people or note how they don’t
            measure up.
    2. Pride: Ministering in a Harsh Spirit
          + This is when we are unkind to others, even other Christians,
            and do not treat them as Christ treats them.
    3. Pride: Putting on Pretenses
          + This is when we act differently than we are, because we want
            to please others.
    4. Pride: Takes Offense Easily
          + This is when we act mean or bitterly when we have been
            offended, instead of being quiet and letting God be the Judge.
    5. Pride: Presumption Before God and Man
          + This is when we are too bold or confident before God, instead
            of treating him with the awe and reverence He deserves.
    6. Pride: Hungry for Attention
          + This is when we do things because we want to be noticed, or we
            think everyone needs our help.
    7. Pride: Neglecting Others
          + This is when we avoid others, especially those who we view to
            be sinful or unteachable. Instead, as Christ came down to our
            level, so should we with others who need spiritual guidance.

   Reading and understanding these symptoms of spiritual pride show us
   “the main door by which the devil comes into the hearts of those who
   are zealous for the advancement of Christ.” (Jonathan Edwards) He says
   that spiritual pride is so important because from it comes all the
   other bad behaviors that lead us astray.

18. Pride in Building a Tower to Reach God

   “Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with
   its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we
--

   At this point in history, there was one language. In this Bible verse,
   the proud people think that they can build a tower to God and be better
   than Him. Since God hates pride, He humbles the people by changing
   their languages and spreading them worldwide.

19. Herod Tries to Be God
--
   he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.” (Acts 12:21-23 ESV)

   Herod puts himself in the place of God by allowing people to worship
   him as a god. The ultimate sign of pride is thinking and allowing
   others to believe that you are God.

20. Pharaoh Refuses to Listen to God
--

   God tells Pharoah by the mouth of Moses to let His people, the
   Israelites, go from slavery under the Egyptians so that they may serve
   the Lord. In a sign of his pride, Pharaoh tells God “no” multiple
   times, is plagued, repents, and then tells God “no” again.

   God plagued Pharoah a total of ten different times:
--

   God continued to give Pharoah chances to obey Him, and began the
   plagues with the least harm to increasing harm as Pharoah continued to
   renege on his promises in his displays of self-righteous pride.

21. The Pride of Haughty Eyes

   “Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin.”
   (Proverbs 21:4 ESV)

   Haughty eyes are often associated with looking down at others. This
   shows that your heart is full of pride because you think you are better
   than others. Instead of looking down on others, we should be looking up
   to God and praying to Him for humble hearts because God gives grace to
   the humble.
--
   so often sadly see in this world today. We are called to love and walk
   in the image of Christ.

22. The Deception of Pride

   “For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives
   himself.” (Galatians 6:3 ESV)

   Prideful people think that they are something special, when none of us
   can compare to God. The good news is that even though we are not
   something, our God is. We get to know the one who created it all.

23. Uzziah’s Pride Leads to Death of Many

   “But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was
   unfaithful to the Lord his God and entered the temple of the Lord to
--
   Uzziah is leading Israel successfully as their king, which leads him to
   go into the temple and give an offering that was not his job. While
   this may seem like a little thing, he did not listen to the rules God
   put in place. The consequences of pride led to the death of many.

24. Jonah Flees From God

--

   The Lord tells Jonah to go and preach about His grace in Nineveh, but
   Jonah does not want to because he does not want those in Nineveh to get
   a second chance. Jonah’s pride led him to run in the opposite direction
   from God. He had so much pride that he thought he could outrun God.

25. Loving Yourself More Than God

--
   The last days are the period of time from the resurrection of Jesus to
   His second coming. During these last times, people will choose to love
   themselves over loving God by giving in to all the sin mentioned in
   these Bible verses. They will be swollen with conceit (pride) because
   they will put other people and things above their love for God.

Conclusion

   The Hebrew word for “pride” can literally be translated as “high.” The
   Hebrew word for “pride” can also be translated as “haughtiness,”
   “boastfulness,” “arrogance,” or “conceit.” As we see from every one of
   these 25 great examples above, sinful pride is when you choose to love
   yourself more than God and the people around you.

   Pride is the opposite of humility or being a humble person with a
   humble spirit and a humble heart. People full of pride choose to use
   God and others to lift themselves up. Where do you see yourself lifting
   up yourself or making yourself the center of attention over God and
   other people?

Examples of Pride in the Bible

   by Godsplanguidedsteps
   No Comments
   Featured Image

   Examples of Pride in the Bible are plentiful. However, there are three
   general characteristics that are described in the Bible for these
   prideful and arrogant people. There is one person who stands out as an
   example of pride in the Bible. That is King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.

General Examples of Pride in the Bible

1. The Prideful Tell Lies

   Those who are prideful will tell lies to make themselves look good.
   Anything to puff themselves up.
   proud, arrogant woman

   Now I don’t know if these prideful people start out with this intention
   or not. But we all have a sinful nature and when our eyes see it as
   good, then we continue on that path. And one lie begets another and
   another.

     For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be
     trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
     Psalm 59:12 ESV

   As we see from this verse, their words enslave them. A person who lies
--
   this world. And the father of lies, who is Satan himself (John 8:44
   ESV)

2. The Prideful Mock Others

   These people who are acting with arrogance have a name, according to
   Solomon. Their name is described by their actions.

     “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with
     arrogant pride.
     Proverbs 21:24 ESV

   They openly mock others because they believe their views are subpar to
--
   who faced rejection on a daily basis. He can identify with your
   cancellation.

3. The Prideful are Deceived

   While the prideful appear In this life to have it all, they really
   don’t. And are being deceived.

     The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts
     of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, “Who
     will bring me down to the ground?”
     Obadiah 1:3: ESV

   Example of pride in the Bible Pride robs a person of peace and joy

   This deception comes from their heart. They devise a plan that is evil.
   They think that their plan will give them the satisfaction that they
--
     peace have joy.
     Proverbs 12:20 ESV

A Biblical Character Example of Pride: King Nebuchadnezzar

   In the story of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar sieged Babylon and took
   captives, including some youth. Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach,
--
   Babylon and his three friends were over the affairs of the province of
   Babylon.

Pride on Display

   So Nebuchadnezzar made a statue like the one in his dream and commanded
   everyone to bow down and worship this statue. If they did not, they
--

     Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of
     heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those
     who walk in pride he is able to humble.
     Daniel 4:37 ESV

   Once he repented and humbled himself before God, he was restored as the
--

A Personal Example

   When I was prideful in my previous job, God humbled me. My job was
   eliminated and I had the choice to take severance and leave or take a
   position in another department. I chose to stay and moved to the other
   department. While it was a humbling experience, God taught me that my
--
   I have been blessed even more in this position because I learned from
   that step of humility to give Him the glory in the work that I do.

   Are you walking in pride? Repent today, God is able to humble you as
   well.

The Kings of Pride

   News and Features | Inside Report Archives
       | The Kings of Pride

   The Kings of Pride
   By Pastor Doug Batchelor
   An Amazing Fact: Joshua Abraham Norton suffered from delusions of
   grandeur. He preferred to be called His Imperial Majesty Norton I, and
--
   a tale about two scheming 19th century friends. The former soldiers set
   off from British India in search of adventure — and ended up as kings
   in what is now part of Afghanistan. It’s a fascinating study of how
   their rise to regal power slowly unleashes the latent pride in their
   hearts, changing their characters and dividing them as friends.
   Most of us have heard the expression “power corrupts, and absolute
   power corrupts absolutely.” This is especially true for monarchs, who
   are exposed to the temptations of pride more than the average person.
   The Bible is replete with examples of men who would be king, and kings
   who wanted to be divine. In fact, we learn that sin entered our
   universe through the portal of pride …
   The Angel Who Would Be God
   In Isaiah 14, we find a fascinating portrait of the first casualty of
   pride’s poison. It’s the story of how the devil became a devil.
   Of course, we know that God did not create the devil. Rather, He
   created a dazzlingly beautiful angel named Lucifer, who was the highest
   of the cherubim, the leader of the heavenly choir, and the most
--
   NKJV, emphasis added). Lucifer clearly had “I” problems.
   As the wayward angel spread his disaffection among the other angels,
   eventually God had to evict him from the courts of glory. But that
   wasn’t the end of pride in God’s creation. In fact, it was the first
   type of temptation that Lucifer, now better known as Satan, presented
   to Adam and Eve. He told them that if they would merely eat the
   forbidden fruit, their eyes would be opened and they would be like God,
   implanting in their hearts and minds his own arrogant desires. And it
   worked.
   Ultimately, pride is a form of idolatry — making ourselves an object of
   worship. The proud aspirations of the devil throughout the great
   controversy all revolve around “me, myself, and I.” And in Ezekiel 28,
   we find a few more details on the many facets of pride that led to
   Lucifer’s fall — pride of power, position, possession, intelligence,
   appearance, and more. The chapter should be a wake-up call to
   Christians in the final era of human history, because these selfish
   characteristics still contribute to the fall of those who eventually
   grieve away the Spirit of the Lord. Indeed, pride is the invisible
   dragnet with which the devil captures the most confident of God’s
   people.

   The Pride of Power

   “Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down
   in the midst of the stones of fire” (Ezekiel 28:14). The Bible spends a
   lot of time on kings who were overcome with pride in their own power,
   which gives the one who wields it incredible attention and adoration,
   feeding selfishness to no end.

   Nebuchadnezzar struggled with this particular pride problem. At the
   zenith of his power, the great Babylonian king had a dream about a tree
   from which the whole world was fed and where every bird found a place
   to roost in its branches. Later he watches the tree being cut down, and
--

   Sounds like the devil, doesn’t it? He took irresponsible credit for
   everything over which he was given reign. God took this precise moment
   in time to send a striking judgment on the prideful king. “While the
   word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O
   king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from
   thee” (v. 31).
--
   the one who deserves our praise, no matter how much power we possess in
   this world. When God gives us the ability to influence others, we
   shouldn’t treat it as if we did it all on our own. We should use that
   power with deep humility. Because of his pride, Nebuchadnezzar lost
   everything. Pride can also bring Christians to a place where we lose
   our access to the kingdom of God, just as it did with the devil.

   Pride in Position

   “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so”
   (Ezekiel 28:14). Some people grow proud of their position at work and
   in life. It is part of the same myriad of issues the devil struggled
   with before he had to be cast out of heaven. Haman in the book of
   Esther provides another prime example of self-destructive pride on
   display in the Bible.

   The mighty Xerxes of Persia learned that a Jew named Mordecai had saved
--
   king, had become angry with Mordecai because the devout Jew would not
   bow before the haughty noble. Haman became so angry, in fact, that he
   wanted to kill all the Jews in the land.
   As Haman’s inflated pride continued to fester, he bragged to his
   friends “of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children,
   and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had
   advanced him above the princes and servants of the king” (Esther 5:11).
--
   because of his own high royal standing. Yet before he could ask the
   king for permission, Xerxes asks Haman, “What should be done for the
   man the king delights to honor?”
   Pride, a distorted mirror that obstructs clear thinking and reason,
   allowed Haman to see only himself. Filled with conceit, “Haman thought
   in his heart, ‘Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?’ ”
   (Esther 6:6 NKJV). The noble quickly devised the most extravagant
--
   Well, can you imagine Haman’s shock with what followed: “The king said
   to Haman, Make haste … as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
   the Jew. … Let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken” (v. 10).
   Haman was commanded to honor the man his pride so desperately wanted to
   murder.
   The Bible says, “When pride cometh, then cometh shame” (Proverbs 11:2).
   The story of Haman is a great example of the ultimate payout of pride.
   He was hung on the gallows he had built for Mordecai.
   This pride of position even infected those closest to Jesus. In Mark 9,
   we find the disciples arguing about which one of them will be greatest
   in Jesus’ kingdom. It was as if they had never heard one of Jesus’ most
   powerful lessons to them: “He who is greatest among you shall be your
--
   you’ve been passed over at your job because of favoritism rather than
   skill? Don’t let it bother you. Be content to serve where God has put
   you. Christ in His time will lift you up.
   Spiritual Pride
   Spiritual pride is a hidden pit in which many unsuspecting Christians
   have fallen. It is especially insidious because it masquerades as
   virtue. The Old Testament King Uzziah was generally a good ruler, but
   he fell through religious pride. He thought he deserved the same
   privileges as the priests. King Saul also lost his kingdom after
   usurping the responsibilities of the priesthood.
   Jesus addressed this fatal flaw in one of His most familiar parables.
--
   before God. But the publican had simple trust in God’s mercy. The
   publican is forgiven, but the Pharisee isn’t. We can’t miss that lesson
   if we want to grow in Christ.
   Spiritual pride is deadly — and it is the bane of the Laodicean church.
   When a person or church says, “I am rich and increased with goods,”
   that’s nothing more than selfish spiritual pride. And God has something
   to say about that. He says that we’re really “poor and wretched and
   blind and naked and don’t know it.” The more spiritually proud you
   become, the more spiritually poor you are. But those who recognize and
--
   In the classic Christ’s Object Lessons, by Ellen White, we learn “The
   evil that led to Peter’s fall and that shut out the Pharisee from
   communion with God is proving the ruin of thousands today. There is
   nothing so offensive to God or so dangerous to the human soul as pride
   and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the most
   incurable” (p. 154).
   That’s why Jesus said, “Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long
--
   in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: Which devour
   widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers” (Mark 12:38 –
   40). These men, says Jesus, will receive even greater condemnation
   because of their unchecked pride.
   Are you encumbered with spiritual pride? Are you proud of your
   knowledge of Bible doctrines? Do you go to church mocking those who
   don’t go the same day as you? Be warned of the spirit of your heart and
   the reasons why you do religious things. Pride is the seed that Satan
   planted to get Jesus nailed to the cross. In Mark 15, we’re told,
   “Pilate answered them [the Jewish leadership], saying, ‘Do you want me
   to release to you the King of the Jews?’ For he knew that the chief
   priests had handed Him over because of envy” (vs. 9, 10 NKJV). It
   offended their pride that Jesus threatened their prominence among the
   people, so they killed Him.
   The Power of Humility
   We’ve examined the destructive power of pride in the life of great
   kings and God’s people. Let’s conclude this study with a little lesson
   on the restorative power of choosing humility.
   The Bible tells us over and over that God wants humble hearts in His
   people. It teaches, “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what
   doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
   to walk humbly with thy God?” (Micah 6:8, emphasis added).
   Pride is a compass needle that always points to self. But we can choose
   to resist that natural tendency. Through God’s Spirit, we can choose to
   be humble. The Bible doesn’t say we should ask God to humble us;
   instead, we are repeatedly invited to humble ourselves (2 Chronicles
--
   realize our true status if God is going to transform us from a worm to
   a butterfly.
   Be Like Christ
   The contrasting examples of Pharaoh’s pride and Moses’ meekness are a
   symbol of Lucifer and Jesus. And each one of us must choose to imitate
   the traits of one or the other. So here is a final unfailing principle
   you should know: God most exalts those who are most humble and humbles</text>

   A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by one Denver Public Schools

   and ChadLaVeglia. The lawsuit argues Nathan Feldman, a father of two
   children attending the K-8 Slavens School in Denver, was denied being
   able to put up a cisgendered, heterosexual flag at school. He says a
   "straight pride" flag represents his children's beliefs and should be
   allowed on campus in the same way LGBTQ+ flags are allowed.

   RELATED: Parent sues Denver Public Schools for his children's right to
   have "straight pride flags" displayed in school

   A spokesperson for LGBTQ Colorado sent the following statement in
   response to the lawsuit:

   A Pride flag is not meant to be exclusive – it is designed to be
   inclusive. It is meant to draw attention and humanity to people who
   historically have been considered "illegal", ostracized, excluded, and
   for too long quiet victims of discrimination and violence.

   A Straight Pride Flag speaks "us vs them" wherein a Pride flag lifts up
   an "all of us" dynamic that recognizes the too often quiet and quieted

Devils find loophole for players to wear Pride-themed jerseys

NHL barred players from wearing any themed jerseys on ice

   such sweaters off the ice.

   The Devils are holding a "Hockey is for Everyone" Night – essentially a
   Pride Night – on Thursday against the Edmonton Oilers.

   Nico Hischier and Akira Achmid wear New Jersey Devils Pride jerseys.

   The organization had a local designer, Kathryn Kennedy, design
   Pride-themed sweaters, and members of the team entered Prudential
   Center wearing them.

   "Coming out is certainly something that’s not always easy, and it can
   take a while for someone to feel comfortable enough to do it," Kennedy
   said. "I can only hope that this design, and Pride Night, helps someone
   else feel respected, even, and welcome.

   "These theme nights let people who are apart of their respective
   communities know that they’re seen, heard, and welcome, that this is
   something for them. It’s a huge honor to be involved in the Devils'
   Pride Night, and my hope is that I’ve created something that helps
   others feel accepted and appreciated."

   Coordinating with the league's policy, the uniforms were not worn on
   the ice during warm-ups. The Devils say they will be auctioned off.

   While the jerseys were not worn on the ice, members of both teams,

   the new jersey regulations were put in place, but after players defied

   The Arizona Coyotes were the first team to hold a Pride night this
   season, with members of the team, similar to the Devils, entering their

   Earlier this season, goalie Marc-Andre Fleury was threatened with
   punishment if he wore a Native American-themed mask to honor his wife's
   background. He did so anyway.

Pride

   The feeling when you possess or have accomplished something that other
   people find praiseworthy. You feel vigorous and have the urge to show
   off to others.

   Pride is primarily about yourself, even when it is not you who did
   something that you are proud about. You can also be proud of something
   someone else did, who you associate with, such as your children or your
   favorite football team. People can feel proud of their culture, their
--
   of others are of crucial importance, as best demonstrated when you
   purposefully do something that other people praise.

   Pride is a social emotion, and to feel proud, you need other people’s
   (real or imagined) confirmation that you have a reason to feel that
   way. Because of this, other people can also ‘be in your head’ and
   prevent you from feeling pride. Namely, what is praiseworthy is
   subjective. Things that may be considered good in a certain (cultural)
   group may not be praiseworthy in another (e.g., if you grew up in a
   family that greatly values academics, your athletic abilities may not
--
   you). Thus, the more exclusive your quality is in your surroundings,
   the prouder you feel.

   Pride has recognizable features. Although its static facial expression
   (typically a smile or laugh) does not clearly distinguish it from other
   positive emotions, it typically results in a bodily posture, gestures,
   and behavior that are clearly recognizable: lifting your chin, looking
--
   more noticeable, as if to say: ‘look at me!’ You may also exhibit more
   perseverance in your activities^2.

   People generally find it very pleasant to experience pride, as it
   elevates our feeling of social self-worth and status^3. At the same
   time, many social groups, religions, and cultures (especially those
   that are highly collectivistic, such as the East Asian or African
   culture) believe that pride needs to be checked. Unchecked pride leads
   to arrogance and misplaced feelings of superiority (‘letting something
   get to your head’, ‘hubris comes before the fall’), and social groups
   typically do not tolerate members feeling like they are superior or

   Do you say you feel pride 'for' something or you feel pride 'in'
   something? 'For' feels right to me, but 'in' seems to make more sense.

   There are two statements where I need it. One is 'pride __ country' and
   the other is 'pride __ army'

   I want to talk about pride as a feeling; as a noun. For example
   "Nationalism is excessive pride of/in one's country'. I don't want to
   say "Nationalism is feeling excessively proud of one's country" or
   "Nationalism is taking excessive pride in one's country" as those
   unnecessarily complicate the sentence. Just to clarify, is the sentence
   "The parade instilled in them a pride in their country" wrong?

     * Those uses are both verbal (I don't know if that's the word, but I
       mean they describe an action) though. I want to talk about pride as

     * @N A: I suppose you could define nationalism as "taking excessive
       pride in one's country", but personally I'd avoid any variant of
       pride/proud in that context, since it's normal for most Anglophones
       (particularly Americans) to strongly endorse patriotism
       (having/taking pride in one's country) whilst decrying nationalism
       (an extreme form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority
       over other countries.)

     * I was just using that as an example. I made it up on the spot.
       Okay, so let's look at patriotism instead. Saying 'Patriotism is
       taking pride in one's country' implies that patriotism is something
       you do, doesn't it? Patriotism is not an action, but a feeling.

       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:58
     * You're quite right. That's why I personally would always write The
       parade instilled in them a sense of pride in their country. But
       this isn't really about vocabulary or syntax as such - we're at the
       level of "writing advice" here.

30 Pride Quotes

   Answer this honestly. Are you proud or prideful? There’s a fine line
   between the two. Pride is an important part of who we are, it’s our
   self esteem for a job well done and it inspires us to push forward and
   do our best. But if your ego takes over, that power is lost because
   you’re not tapping into the humility we should all keep close. Enjoy
   these Pride Quotes; I hope they help you foster healthy self-esteem and
   build your confidence!

   Pride Won’t Let You Learn

The way pride is ingrained in those who exhibit this sheer arrogance is that
it’s convoluted with a hint of ignorance and a dash of recklessness. In a
less complicated sentence, proud people are ignorant of the consequences of
their speech or actions.
--
   stop spending time preparing and improving because we’re sure that we
   know.

   Pride comes as a result of knowledge and confidence. You know what you
   know and no one can take away that knowledge. That knowledge boosts
   your confidence level and you’re ready to take on the world but pride
   wants you to take a piss on the world regardless of the beauty other
   people are trying to create on its canvas.

   For you to learn a thing, you’d have to come to terms with the fact
   that you haven’t experienced it. You might have heard and read about
   it, but you haven’t had a real-time meet with it and pride won’t let
   you think this.

     Pride confuses ignorance as just a lack of knowledge issue. But real
     intelligence knows ignorance is also inadequate information or
     knowledge. Ignorance is knowledge that isn’t yielding appropriate
     results.

   If there’s anything you know about, have read about or are studying
   that isn’t generating your envisioned consequence, there’s an ignorance
   gap and pride might not let you accept this sheer and cold truth.

   So, you keep feeding yourself with more updates and latest information
   thinking that staying in touch would somehow create that learning
--
   one-sided versions of their lives. And because we live in a connected
   world, people can’t mind their businesses.

Don’t let pride shut the door against the life you really want. Call for
help, heck! Scream for it. Get on your knees, put on your dungarees, get your
hands dirty and get to work. Call up someone to teach you if you can. Pay for
that workshop to learn that skill that you know is relevant for where you’re
--
Speak to someone about the challenges you’re facing.

   In the words of Maria Forleo, everything is figureoutable, but the
   caveat is for only those who are willing to set pride aside and learn.

   Pride can only get you as far as it can but not as far as you want.
   You’re struggling because there’s something or a bunch of stuff you’re
   yet to learn and that’s okay.</text>
