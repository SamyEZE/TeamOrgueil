   [220px-Allegory_of_Pride_Met_DP888806.jpg] Allegory of pride, from c.
   1590–1630, engraving, 22.3 cm × 16.6 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of
   Art (New York City)

   Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or
   "confidence and satisfaction in oneself".^[1] Oxford defines it as "the
   quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own
   importance."^[2] Pride may be related to one's own abilities or
   achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's
   country. Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of
   oneself",^[3] as opposed to false pride or narcissism. Similarly, St.
   Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence",^[4] and
   Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism
   manifests."^[5]

   Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a
   complex secondary emotion that requires the development of a sense of
   self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that
   pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based
   interaction with others.^[6] Some social psychologists identify the
   nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional,
   automatically perceived signal of high social status.^[7]

   Pride may be considered the opposite of shame or of humility,^[8]
   sometimes as proper or as a virtue, and sometimes as corrupt or as a
   vice. With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of
   attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward
   a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent
   self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Other possible
   objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sex identity (for
   example LGBT pride).^[citation needed] With a negative connotation
   pride refers to a foolishly^[9] and irrationally corrupt sense of one's
   personal value, status or accomplishments,^[10] used synonymously with
   hubris.

   While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw)
   consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions
   consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in
   Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root
   of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known
   as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed
   as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt,
   vanity, or vainglory.

Etymology[edit]

   Proud comes from late Old English prut, probably from Old French prud
   "brave, valiant" (11th century) (which became preux in French), from
   Late Latin term prodis "useful", which is compared with the Latin
   prodesse "be of use".^[11] The sense of "having a high opinion of
   oneself", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the
   Norman knights who called themselves "proud".^[12]

Ancient Greek philosophy[edit]

   Aristotle identified pride (megalopsuchia, variously translated as
   proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity)^[13] as the crown
   of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and
   humility, thus:

     By a high-minded man we seem to mean one who claims much and
     deserves much: for he who claims much without deserving it is a
     fool; but the possessor of a virtue is never foolish or silly. The
     man we have described, then, is high-minded. He who deserves little
     and claims little is temperate [or modest], but not high-minded: for
     high-mindedness [or greatness of soul] implies greatness, just as
     beauty implies stature; small men may be neat and well proportioned,
     but cannot be called beautiful.^[14]

   He concludes then that

     High-mindedness, then, seems to be the crowning grace, as it were,
     of the virtues; it makes them greater, and cannot exist without
     them. And on this account it is a hard thing to be truly
     high-minded; for it is impossible without the union of all the
     virtues.^[14]

   By contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows:

     to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen
     to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for
     your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries;
     this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this:
     naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own
     superiority the greater.^[15]

   Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for
   Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing
   from pride.

Psychology[edit]

   Pride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and
   evaluative; its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the
   self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies
   with.^[10] The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame
   as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of
   oneself and one's behavior according to internal and external
   standards.^[16] Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a
   standard; guilt or shame from defying it. There is a lack of research
   that addresses pride, perhaps because it is despised as well as valued
   in the individualist West, where it is experienced as pleasurable.^[17]

  Emotion[edit]

   In psychological terms, positive pride is "a pleasant, sometimes
   exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive
   self-evaluation".^[18] It was added to the University of California,
   Davis, "Set of Emotion Expressions", as one of three "self-conscious"
   emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with
   embarrassment and shame).^[19]

   The term "fiero" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to
   describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a
   personal triumph over adversity.^[20] Facial expressions and gestures
   that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or
   arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant
   status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in
   cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show
   that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is
   automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status
   in a group.^[7]

   Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded
   posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from
   the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in
   congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see
   it in others.^[21]

  Positive outcomes[edit]

   Pride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal
   goals; for example positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a
   person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person
   alone.^[22]^[full citation needed]

   Pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of
   similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak
   others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a
   hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid
   negotiations of conflict.^[23]

   Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It
   is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where
   the individual is proud".^[24]^[full citation needed] Pride is
   associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and
   outward promotion^[clarification needed]. Along with hope, it is an
   emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger
   and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming
   evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility
   of the effort expended.^[25]^[full citation needed] Pride can enhance
   creativity, productivity, and altruism.^[26]^[full citation needed]
   Pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically
   advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods,
   pride is associated with a lower GPA.^[27]

  Economics[edit]

   In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a
   spectrum ranging from "proper pride", associated with genuine
   achievements, and "false pride", which can be maladaptive or even
   pathological. Lea et al. examined the role of pride in various economic
   situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because
   economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are
   linked together by the selfhood of the people who take
   them^[clarification needed].^[28] Understood in this way, pride is an
   emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial
   decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short
   term they would appear irrational.

  Sin and self-acceptance[edit]

   See also: Self-esteem § Contingent vs. non-contingent

   [180px-Pride%2C_Jacob_Matham.png] Pride, from the Seven Deadly Sins by
   Jacob Matham c. 1592.

   Inordinate self-esteem is called "pride".^[29] Classical Christian
   theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and
   thus^[non sequitur] high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human
   problem, but beginning in the 20th century, "humanistic psychology"
   diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a
   lack of belief in one's "true worth". Carl Rogers observed that most
   people "regard themselves as worthless and unlovable." Thus, they lack
   self-esteem.^[30]^: 40, 87, 95 

   In the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled
   with the term, "Haughty".

     Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

   — King James Version of the Bible (1611), Book of Proverbs, 16:18

   Terry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as
   an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He
   examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride
   is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the
   experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does
   not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic
   psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front
   designed to protect an undervalued self.^[30]

   He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts,
   namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in dealing with^[clarification
   needed] what he calls a "deadlock between the overvalued and
   undervalued self".^[30]^: 112–13  Cooper refers to their work in
   describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as
   well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an
   appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:

     The "idealized self," the "tyranny of the should," the "pride
     system", and the nature of self-hate all point toward the
     intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt.
     Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of
     self-contempt and low self-esteem.^[sentence
     fragment]^[30]^: 112–13 

   Thus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes
   actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the hubristic
   person feels deep down.

  Hubris and group narcissism[edit]

   Main article: Hubris

   See also: Group narcissism

   Hubris is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and
   is commonly related to^[clarification needed] expressions of aggression
   and hostility.^[31]^[full citation needed] Hubris is not necessarily
   associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or
   variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to
   create conflict and sometimes to terminate close relationships, which
   has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear
   positive or adaptive functions.^[32]^[full citation needed]

   A group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a
   group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other
   groups.^[33]^[better source needed] "[H]ubristic, pompous displays of
   group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of
   strength,"^[This quote needs a citation] while those who express pride
   by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and
   hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public
   and personal eyes.

   Research from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride
   correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement and promotes
   prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with
   self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes
   toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.^[34]

  Across the world[edit]

   Pride in ones own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally
   have positive connotations,^[dubious – discuss]^[35] though like
   earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have
   been known to commit atrocities.^[36]

   Types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The
   difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the
   U.S. and China.^[ambiguous]^[37] In the U.S., individual pride
   tends^[clarification needed] and seems to be held more often in
   thought. The people in China seem to hold greater views^[clarification
   needed] for the nation as a whole.^[38]

   The value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to
   be a running theme and debate among cultures.^[39] This debate shadows
   the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride
   shouldn't be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about
   which form of it is the most useful.^[39]

   Pride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures
   largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was
   popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late
   sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk
   named Evagrius Ponticus in the fourth century as one of the evils human
   beings should resist. ^[40]

  German[edit]

   offspring of Greed and Pride.

   Main article: German nationalism

   In Germany, "national pride" ("Nationalstolz") is often associated with
   Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to
   be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate
   about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in
   Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not
   seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant
   support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team
   progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support
   across the nation.^[41]

  Asian[edit]

   Main article: Asian pride

   The term "Asian pride" in modern usage refers mostly to those of East
   Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian
   pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had
   conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese
   religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged
   prominently during European colonialism.^[42] At one time, Europeans
   controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in
   anti-Western feelings among Asian nations.^[42] Today, some Asians
   still look upon European involvement in their affairs with
   suspicion.^[42] In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by
   adherents of Asian Pride.

  Black[edit]

   Main article: Black pride

   Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise
   awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by
   African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin or ancestry to denote a
   feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one's heritage,
   and being proud of one's worth.

  White[edit]

   Main article: White pride

   White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white
   separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist
   organizations in the United States for a white race
   identity.^[43]^[full citation needed] White pride also consists of
   white ethnic/cultural pride.

Mad[edit]

   Mad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that mentally ill
   people should be proud of their madness. It advocates mutual support
   and rallies for their rights,^[44] and aims to popularize the word
   "mad" as a self-descriptor.^[45]

LGBT[edit]

   LGBT pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals
   should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT
   pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT
   people.^[46] The movement has three main premises: that people should
   be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual
   diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity
   are inherent and cannot be intentionally
   altered.^[47]^[better source needed]

   The word "pride" is used in this case as an antonym for "shame". It is
   an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement
   began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the
   first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year
   anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising
   between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of
   Stonewall Inn.^[48]

Vanity[edit]

   Main article: Vanity

   [220px-Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_%28Superbia%29.jpg]
   Detail of "Pride" in The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things by
   Hieronymus Bosch

   In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense
   to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness,
   and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers
   to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one's abilities
   or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in that sense be
   compared to pride. The term vanity originates from the Latin word
   vanitas meaning emptiness, untruthfulness, futility, foolishness, and
   empty pride.^[49] Here empty pride means a fake pride, in the sense of
   vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but
   sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.
   [220px-Alexandre_Cabanel_-_Fallen_Angel.jpg] "The Fallen Angel" (1847)

   21%2C_NGA_5360.jpg] Jacques Callot, Pride (Vanity), probably after 1621

   In many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in
   which one rejects God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby
   becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and
   Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a
   pernicious aspect of vanity.

   In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in
   Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity
   was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or
   reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with a comb and mirror.
   The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols of
   vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of
   death himself.
   [170px-Allisvanity.jpg] "All Is Vanity" by C. Allan Gilbert, evoking
   the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward death

   Often depicted is an inscription on a scroll that reads Omnia Vanitas
   ("All is Vanity"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of
   Ecclesiastes.^[50] Although that phrase—itself depicted in a type of
   still life called vanitas—originally referred not to an obsession with
   one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in
   this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the
   subject of the picture. "The artist invites us to pay lip-service to
   condemning her", writes Edwin Mullins, "while offering us full
   permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while
   we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind
   of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her."^[51]
   The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the
   non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.

   In his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a
   bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind
   her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier,
   which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is An Allegory of Justice and
   Vanity. A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does
   not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer's
   famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is sometimes believed to
   depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before
   a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.^[52] All is
   Vanity, by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An
   optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large
   grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a
   young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror of her vanity table.
   Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of
   youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the
   inevitability of death.

Abstract

Background

   Pride is one of the most meaningful experiences in daily life. Many
   psychological studies emphasize self-oriented and event-based
   achievements as the main sources of pride, whereas work from
   organizational management considers pride as a collective attitude
   derived from other-focused activities and fostered by the sense of
   belongingness. Taking the interdisciplinary aspects of pride into
   account, this article addresses the challenge of how experience design
   can contribute to pride experience in the workplace.

Methods

   By cross-cutting theories from psychology and organizational
   management, this study introduces a framework of dynamic pride. The
   data includes 20 experience design cases that were specifically devoted
   to positive experiences in the context of the metal and engineering
   industry. 33 pride-related experience design goals were analyzed and
   categorized into the framework of pride.

Results

   This study introduces the social and temporal dimensions of pride
   experience at work. The pride-related experience design goals fall into
   four categories: self-focused short-term pride, self-focused long-term
   pride, other-focused short-term pride, and other-focused long-term
   pride. Accordingly, the extracted design strategies of these goals were
   mapped to each type of pride. Most of these design strategies were
   clustered in the categories of self-focused short-term pride and
   other-focused long-term pride.

Conclusions

   This study reveals the design strategies for dynamics of pride in the
   workplace varying from evoking self-achievement in individual
   interactions with tools to maintaining long-term motivation of
   self-competence development, and from highlighting one’s contribution
   in face-to-face collaborative work facilitated by interactive tools to
   fostering co-experience of organizational pride throughout social
   events.

Background

   People feel life holds more meaning when they are motivated by
   cherished goals, aware of self-improvement, involved in healthy
   interpersonal relationships, and loyal to their beliefs. In essence,
   these profound experiences of meaning make life worth living (e.g.,
   Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi 2000). However, the contribution of
   subjective value experiences, especially those of happiness, has not
   gained adequate attention in empirical research until the emergence of
   positive psychology. This new branch of psychology shifted the research
   focus from pathology to optimal human function and flourishing
   (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi 2000), and it addresses how to enable
   individuals and communities to thrive (Seligman 2011).

   Positive psychology has promoted human flourishing as the ultimate goal
   of scientific research. It has been increasingly applied to other
   disciplines, such as education, policy, management, mental health,
   computer science, engineering, and design (Calvo and Peters 2014, p.
   25). In the field of human–computer interaction, the “positive
   technology” approach was proposed to utilize interactive technologies
   for personal experience optimization (Riva et al. 2012). From the
   perspective of multidisciplinary efforts, Calvo and Peters (2014) refer
   to this area of design and development of technology for psychological
   wellbeing and human potential as “positive computing”.

   Highly connected with technology and engineering, the discipline of
   design (e.g., industrial design, product design, and interaction
   design) has been inspired by the mindset of positive psychology: from
   preventing pain towards promoting happiness, from material sufficiency
   towards experiential value (Pohlmeyer 2012), from immediate response
   towards long-term impact, and from designing solutions towards
   designing possibilities (Desmet and Hassenzahl 2012; Jensen 2014).
   Human flourishing has essentially changed the traditional design
   process, exemplified by recent scholarly advice, such as “think
   experience before product” (Hassenzahl 2010) and “first decide what
   kind of experience to be aimed for and then design certain features to
   evoke the targeted experience” (Desmet and Schifferstein 2011). Design
   approaches, such as experience-based design (Bate and Robert 2007),
   experience-centered design (Wright and McCarthy 2010),
   experience-driven design (Desmet and Schifferstein 2011), positive
   design (Desmet and Pohlmeyer 2013), experience design (Hassenzahl et
   al. 2013) and design for profound experiences (Jensen 2014), prioritize
   quality experience goals over material-level requirements. One typical
   experience design case introduced by Hassenzahl (2010) is Philips
   wake-up light simulating sunrise and bird singing for natural wake-up
   experience in the morning. Combining an alarm clock and a bedside lamp,
   it guides user gently out of a deep sleep phase by progressively
   increasing in light intensity and volume of bird singing. Adding to
   this understanding of experience design, Lu and Roto (2014) defined an
   experience goal addressing in-depth meaning as the starting point and
   driver of design process. Functionality and usability requirements are
   submissive to ultimate experience goals.

   To facilitate the designers’ adaptation to this mindset change, design
   researchers have started to translate knowledge from the field of
   psychology into design approaches. Hassenzahl et al. (2010) selected
   six out of 10 psychological needs (Sheldon et al. 2001) and suggested
   utilizing an “experience pattern” as a tool to distill the essence of
   an experience and transfer it to the targeted context. Desmet (2012)
   introduced a basic set of 25 positive emotion types and proposed six
   main sources of positive emotions in human product interactions. Desmet
   and Pohlmeyer (2013) created a framework suggesting three ingredients
   of design for human flourishing: pleasure, personal significance, and
   virtue. Calvo and Peters (2014) identified the determinant factors of
   wellbeing and provided the strategies to develop a certain factor as
   well as its evaluation methods. For the specific context of the
   industrial work environment, Lu and Roto (2015) borrowed the knowledge
   on the meaning of work (Rosso et al. 2010) and provided high-level
   design strategies for evoking meaningful experiences at work regarding
   work tool design, such as promoting competence for the perception of
   personal significance. These frameworks address positive experiences as
   the root of design, and open the door to design for wellbeing in
   general. However, these theories may arguably appear too essential,
   comprehensive, or concise for designers, and scarcely reach to the fine
   granularity required for design action. The nature of design practice
   remains highly context-dependent and the resulting design is required
   to be concrete and to manifest in details. Therefore, more explicit and
   practicable strategies for experience design are needed regarding a
   specific experience in a targeted context.

   This study aims to investigate design strategies for human flourishing
   with a special focus on pride experience in the workplace, because the
   nature of pride is full of richness regarding meaningful experiences at
   work. According to the positive computing framework (Calvo and Peters
   2014, p. 87), pride covers the dimension from intra-personal pride that
   is experienced within oneself (e.g., feelings of self-achievement) to
   interpersonal pride that is experienced from interaction between
   oneself and others (e.g., perception of respect from others). From the
   perspective of time, pride can be experienced as a moment-by-moment
   positive emotion evoked by unstable events, such as success in a
   challenging task. Also, pride can be considered as a cumulative
   experience based on a long-term rational attitude, such as loyalty
   towards one’s community. In contrast to the richness of pride, current
   design research studies provide limited sources of design for pride,
   which are mainly constrained by the mere scope of product design and
   the perspective of self-achievement and personal distinct possession
   (Desmet 2012).

   Pride as a meaningful experience design goal in the workplace is worth
   investigating further. This study specifically strives to provide
   designers concrete design-for-pride strategies from two angles: the
   literature review on the multiple facets of pride and the empirical
   data on pride embodiment in design concepts. Accordingly, with a
   special focus on workplace, this study addresses two research
   questions: first, to identify what are the dimensions of pride that
   help designers to understand the design space for pride experience;
   second, to distinguish the strategies that designers have used so far
   in the design-for-pride cases. By synthesizing theoretical and
   empirical knowledge, this study proposes a multi-dimensional framework
   of design-mediated pride^Footnote 1 and the design strategies for
   evoking dynamics of pride in the workplace.

   The remaining sections of this paper are structured accordingly: first,
   a theoretical framework of pride based on literature review is
   presented and the need of knowledge on design-mediated pride is
   identified; second, 20 cases that were designed for positive experience
   at work are analyzed based on self-focus to other-focus dimensions and
   short-term to long-term timespans; third, derived from these cases, the
   design strategies for evoking pride experience at work are proposed;
   finally, the insights from these design strategies are discussed.

Literature Review

Psychological Structure of Pride

   Pride is a fundamental human emotion involving a complex
   self-evaluative process (Tracy and Robins 2004). Different from other
   “purely” basic emotions, such as the universally admired emotion of
   love or the universally reviled emotion of jealousy (Williams and
   DeSteno 2009), pride is comprised of two distinct facets. To this
   extent, Tangney (1990) referred to “alpha” pride as pride in self and
   “beta” pride as pride in behavior. Furthermore, Tracy and Robins (2004)
   distinguished between authentic pride and hubristic pride: authentic
   pride is evoked by accomplishment from successful behavior and
   positively related to genuine self-esteem and prosocial traits, whereas
   hubristic pride is more towards self-aggrandizement and positively
   related to narcissism (Tracy et al. 2014). Additionally, the two facets
   of pride differ from each other in cognitive antecedents (Tracy and
   Robins 2007b). Authentic pride is triggered more by unstable, specific,
   and controllable attributions, such as solid results due to hard work,
   whereas hubristic pride is more likely to occur from stable, global,
   and uncontrollable causes, such as feelings of superiority from “who I
   am” (Tracy and Robins 2007b). As this study focuses on designing for
   positive pride, hubristic pride is excluded in the scope of this paper.

Self-Focus Versus Other-Focus

   Both self- and other-focused pride are sources of positive emotion
   (Desmet 2012); moreover, the categories of self and social have been
   identified as wellbeing factors (Calvo and Peters 2014). Self-focused
   pride emphasizes more on interaction within oneself and response to
   oneself whereas other-focused pride accentuates interpersonal
   interaction and the influence between self and others. Most studies
   emphasize pride as a self-conscious and performance-related experience
   triggered by self-efficacy (Tracy and Robins 2007a). Besides its
   elicitation through self-achievement, pride as a fundamental social
   emotion can also be “generated by appraisals when one is responsible
   for a socially valued outcome or for being a socially valued person”
   (Mascolo and Fischer 1995, p. 66). Moral accomplishment and prosocial
   actions are associated with the feeling of pride that may motivate and
   reinforce one’s socially valued conduct (Tangney et al. 2007), such as
   caregiving (Tracy and Robins 2007b), treating others well (Michie
   2009), and positively responding to others’ emotions and needs (Leffel
   et al. 2008). Nakamura’s (2013) related work suggests that compared
   with self-oriented achievement, other-oriented prosocial action has an
   even stronger relationship to pride in both family life and work life.
   Therefore, no matter whether it is triggered by self-oriented task
   accomplishment or other-oriented altruistic activities, pride functions
   as both a “barometer” and “motivator” (McCullough et al. 2001) in
   assessing, regulating, and encouraging one’s behavior toward being
   “good, competent, and virtuous” (Haidt 2003, p. 860).

Short-Term Versus Long-Term

   Pride derived from subjective histories of success may promote
   eagerness towards new anticipatory goals (Katzenbach 2003b). This
   promotion-related eagerness may energize and enhance performance
   (Higgins et al. 2001) and thus renew the experience of pride. As such,
   pride can transition from a temporary emotional experience towards a
   durable attitude of pride. According to the timespans of user
   experience (Roto et al. 2011), a new challenging goal may evoke an
   anticipatory pride for a person with a subjective history of success
   (Higgins et al. 2001); incremental progress in problem solving may
   elicit a momentary pride; when reflecting on an overcome challenge, a
   person may feel an episodic pride in the achievement. These
   performance-related types of pride are short-term, event-specific, and
   ascribed to internal attributes, such as ability or effort (Weiner
   1985). Additionally, another kind of long-term and cognitive
   attitudinal pride exists in organizational studies, which does not rely
   on single events, but cumulative experience related to the overall
   evaluation of a target (Gouthier and Rhein 2011), such as being proud
   of one’s community.

Pride Experience at Work

   Pride is one of the most intense experiences in work life (Katzenbach
   2003b), and work itself is a source of pride (Hodson 1998). Katzenbach
   (2003b) distinguishes institution-building pride which is based on
   largely intangible value and collective interest from self-serving
   pride which is driven by power and materialism.

   Employees can take intrinsic pride in what they make, how they work,
   and whom they work with (Katzenbach 2003b). Experience of pride in
   achievement can be empathized by others in social interaction at work
   and thereby contribute to psychological empowerment and promote future
   successes (Froman 2010). Katzenbach (2003b) introduces a powerful
   “closed loop of energy” derived from pride: better performance
   contributes to business success, and recognized business success
   instills a strong feeling of pride, which fuels future better
   performance. This cycle can be repeatedly applied in organizational
   management.

   Gouthier and Rhein (2011) discern two types of organizational pride:
   one is an emotional pride triggered by successful organizational
   events, and the other is a cognitive and durable attitude of pride
   oriented from the general perception of the organization and employees’
   sense of belonging to the organization (Lea and Webley 1997). On this
   matter, the celebration of successful events, presence of a successful
   company history and culture, and successful advertising campaigns have
   been identified as activators of organizational pride (Gouthier and
   Rhein 2011).

   In summary, pride experience can be derived from self-focused
   achievement and other-focused interpersonal interaction. The richness
   of pride also lies in covering a timespan from a temporary emotion to a
   durable attitude. Pride can be intensively experienced in the
   workplace, and intrinsic pride can be evoked by organizational
   celebration and reputation. From the psychology and organizational
   management literature review, two dimensions of pride were identified
   relevant for design: social dimension from self-focused to
   other-focused and temporal dimension from short-term to long-term
   (Fig. 1).

Design for Pride Experience

   Recently, design researchers have started to explore how design can
   contribute to pride experience. Desmet (2012) introduced pride among
   the 25 positive emotions in the scope of human-product interactions:
   pride may be evoked by owning a unique product, being able to use a
   complex product, achieving something a product facilitates, or
   receiving positive feedback from others concerning the product one
   owns. Based on Desmet’s work, Yoon et al. (2013) developed a tool to
   facilitate emotional granularity in design and specified that pride may
   be triggered by “one’s praiseworthy behavior surpassing internal and
   external standard, and/or one recognizes that others appreciate it”
   (ibid., p.8). Compared with the two dimensions of pride (Fig. 1), pride
   as a collective experience in social interaction (Battarbee and
   Koskinen 2005) and the long-term cumulative experience has not yet been
   fully addressed in existing experience design theories.

   One example of positive design for pride given by Desmet and Pohlmeyer
   (2013) is a designed social interactive activity in which patients with
   dementia can match record pieces in order to play music from their past
   on a turntable with others; thus, a feeling of pride may arise from
   task completion within the social interaction. Moreover, two cases of
   work tool design for meaningful experience at work (Lu and Roto 2015)
   indicate that employees may feel proud of mastering a tool and being
   part of an organization; meanwhile, customers may experience pride when
   they make a right decision on a tool purchase and present manufactured
   tools to their clients. These design examples suggest how designers
   shape the conditions that may evoke a pride experience in a specific
   context. These cases reveal different strategies of designing for
   dynamics of pride. On one hand, those theoretical sources of pride,
   such as achievement, competence, owning something special, and positive
   appraisal from self and others, are clearly embodied in these three
   cases. On the other hand, when referring to a pride experience in a
   specific context, designers seem to employ specific context-adapted
   design strategies, such as utilizing the positive relationship between
   personalized music and a patient with dementia, developing the
   employee’s perceptions of organizational reputation, and highlighting
   one’s contribution of a right decision to an organization.

   Because the nature of design knowledge is highly applicable and
   practice-driven (Cross 2001), besides the theoretical perspective, it
   is meaningful to examine how different types of pride were designed for
   in the concrete cases. This study aims to help designers to discover
   profound and unique sources of pride experience in the specific context
   of the workplace. The design-for-pride strategies employed by the
   collected cases will be identified and analyzed against the theoretical
   dimensions of pride (Fig. 1).

Methods

   This study falls under research for design category of design research,
   since the main aim of this work is to improve design practice (Frayling
   1993). In line with Zimmerman et al. (2010), this research for design
   activity yields to a framework and design recommendations that help
   designers in their work. Besides a literature review, the research data
   is also derived from empirical design studies. The specific design
   approach under study is experience design, in which experience goals
   are the key prerequisite for design activity and defined in the early
   stage of the design process. Experience goals drive the whole design
   process and evolve into the designed artifacts that may evoke the
   targeted experience (Lu and Roto 2015). Thus, this study proposes that
   the design strategies for shaping a certain experience can be distilled
   from the argumentation of the experience goal realization in the design
   concepts. According to the premise of experience design, any kind of
   design that best fulfills the experience goals can be the design
   outcome. In the workplace context, specifically, this may mean a tool,
   service, space, or even an event.

   The authors of this paper studied the reports of 20 experience design
   cases that were conducted in collaboration with masters-level design
   students and seven companies in the metal and engineering industry from
   2012 to 2015. The given design briefs from the different companies
   share the same high-level goal to design for meaningful experience at
   work in heavy industry. The differences among the 20 assignments lie in
   the design contexts varying from heavy machine operation (e.g., crane
   remote control, tugboat console, control room of automation system) to
   the peripheral touchpoints for different stakeholders involved in the
   industrial system (e.g., a mobile application for factory automation
   customers, a mobile sales application for ship components, a mobile
   crane monitoring application).

   In the beginning of the design course, experience design approaches
   were taught to the students by at least one of the authors. Design
   teams were then comprised of two to three master students who worked
   full time on a two-month design assignment from one company. Each
   company assignment was tackled by one team of students. All the teams
   underwent the following design process: familiarizing oneself with the
   target context and users, defining a set of profound experience goals,
   deriving concepts from the determined goals, and finally evaluating
   design concepts against these goals with relevant stakeholders. Most
   teams produced two design concepts: one called ‘incremental’ to address
   the company’s current needs, and another called ‘radical’, which was
   supposed to radically improve the user experience and show what
   experience design could mean without limitations for the outcome. The
   students defined the experience goals based on different sources
   (Kaasinen et al. 2015), and they had the freedom to set up goals that
   would fit their case briefs. In each case, experience goals were
   formatted into a word or a short phrase for convenient communication
   among different stakeholders. There was no special rule with regard to
   how many experience goals the students should define, whereas the
   relations between a set of experience goals were expected for
   clarification. Involved throughout the whole design process, the
   company personnel were available for providing information and
   comments. At least one of the authors followed these cases by arranging
   weekly meetings with the design teams and reading their design diaries.
   The students were not given special guidance for designing for pride,
   as pride was not a presumed design goal in any of the assignments.
   Rather, the students were trained to identify multiple profound
   experience goals for the targeted workplace contexts. Only after a
   majority of cases ended up pride-related experience goals, the authors
   got interested in a deeper study of pride experience at work. Hence the
   analysis of the design cases was retrospective and the final reports of
   the student teams served as the primary data source for this part of
   the research.

Four Design Case Examples

   The design case description can provide better understanding of the
   experience design in the industrial workplace context. Due to the
   limited length of this article, this section will shortly describe four
   example cases that tackled pride from different perspectives.

   The customer for the first experience design case was Kemppi, a
   manufacturer of welding machines. The task was to design a mobile
   application with which people (e.g. welding students) could train their
   welding skills with welding without the actual welding equipment, but
   rather with the help of a welding simulator game. The design students
   drew three experience goals: Pleasure (the joy of welding),
   Self-motivation (willingness to practice constantly), and Pride (about
   their skills, the results, and the welding itself). The Pleasure goal
   was tackled by gamification features; Self-motivation by sharing and
   communicating the progress; and Pride by a physical certificate after
   completing all levels of training (Fig. 2). The incremental concept was
   a mobile application as suggested in the assignment, and the radical
   concept focused on the best possible pride experience by inviting
   selected application users to showcase their real-life welding skills
   in an event similar to an art exhibition.

   Another kind of experience design case was completed for Konecranes,
   focusing on the maintenance services of cranes at waste-to-energy
   plants. After studying the employees at the plant, the students set
   goals for the crane maintenance service experience. Of the three goals,
   two were related to the pride experience: Worthiness (an affirmation of
   their importance as a customer) and Belongingness (a meaningful
   relationship with Konecranes employees). The radical concept is called
   Mood sphere, consisting of a light ball at the plant and an identity
   badge for each employee. Both the badge and the ball show the status of
   the crane and the related Konecranes service. The crane operators can
   interact with the ball to communicate their feelings about the crane
   and its service (Fig. 3).
   Fig. 3
   figure 3

   and the operator can send emotional messages to Konecranes service by
   interacting with the ball

   In the third case, students were asked to redesign a tugboat steering
   simulator for Rolls-Royce Marine. The objective was to create a quality
   experience both for the salesperson demonstrating the steering
   properties with different thruster options and for the customer wanting
   to see its functionality. The task for the students was focused on the
   physical design of the simulator, consisting of two big joystick
   devices and a display. The practical goal was to enable a portable
   system. The experience goals were derived with the salesperson’s
   experience in mind, since the salesperson is the primary user of the
   simulator. The students utilized the metaphor of Q from the James Bond
   movies and set three experience goals that all were related to the
   experience of pride: Sense of directing (directing the situation by
   suggesting possible solutions), Expertise (presenting oneself as a
   professional, technical expert), and Pride (proudly representing the
   company). The design strategy to fulfill the Sense of directing goal
   was to boost the feeling of control; Expertise goal by using impressive
   technology; and Pride by drawing attention with a novel way of
   presentation. The radical solution proposed by the students was a
   simulator vehicle, similar to a Segway, with the steering joysticks
   mounted on it (Fig. 4).

   The last experience design task reported here was assigned by a factory
   automation company, Fastems, who wanted to extend their training center
   into a visitor space. In this case, the company already had defined
   company-wide experience goals (Roto et al. 2015) for experience
   development projects, from which the students derived four experience
   goals for this specific case. One of these was Participation for pride,
   which aims to foster a pride experience in customers by being able to
   influence the development activities at Fastems. In addition to the
   physical space design in the center of the factory activities, students
   proposed an interactive table as a collaboration platform• in the space
   (Fig. 5).

Selecting Pride-Related Experience Goals

   To decide whether a case is an endeavor for evoking a pride experience
   at work, the authors analyzed the final reports of all student teams,
   and examined the description of each experience goal setting and its
   infusion into a design concept. Compared to the existing guidance on
   designing for pride, this study adopted a broader and deeper
   understanding of pride based on the literature study. Besides the
   experience goals literally labeled with “pride”, those having the
   potential to elicit pride experience were also taken into account as
   pride-related experience goals and their relevance to pride is
   indicated in Table 1. The researchers interpreted the implication of
   these goals situated in the design context rather than their original
   meaning. For example, in the Kemppi case introduced above, pride as a
   long-term experience is based on a momentary pleasurable pride and
   episodic evaluative pride in self-motivation and thus Pleasure and
   Self-motivation are grouped into pride-related experience goals. On the
   other hand, if the experience goals and their embodiment in the final
   concepts both have little connection with pride, then these goals are
   excluded in this study.

   Full size table

   In these 20 design cases, altogether 61 experience goals were
   identified and more than half (33) of them were pride-related.
   Meanwhile, only two cases out of 20 have little connection with pride:
   one stressed Discovery as an experience in taking an elevator; the
   other focused on a Trust experience evoked by the designed cover for an
   expensive ship component placed outside.

Analyzing Pride-Related Experience Goals Against Two Dimensions of Pride

   Each goal was then postulated to fall into the category either
   long-term or short-term experience. Two researchers (the authors)
   conducted the goal categorization independently, resulting to an
   inter-rater agreement of 87.88 %. Consensus was reached by discussion.
   These pride-related experience goals were also categorized along the
   self-focus or other-focus dimension. The inter-rater agreement in this
   case was 72.73 %, and the consensus was reached by discussion.

   Combining the two categorizations, each selected experience goal was
   supposed to belong to one of these four groups: self-focused short-term
   pride, self-focused long-term pride, other-focused short-term pride,
   and other-focused long-term pride. Accordingly, the design strategies
   used by the students for different types of pride were compared within
   and across categories.

Results

   According to the social dimension, 17 out of 33 pride-related
   experience goals are self-focused, whereas the remaining 16 goals are
   other-focused. Along the temporal dimension, 15 out of 33 pride-related
   experience goals are short-term, and the rest are long-term. The
   experience goals for self-focus short-term pride and other-focus
   long-term pride both take one-third of all the pride-related experience
   goals whereas other-focus short-term pride was the least designed for.

   As shown in Fig. 6, different design strategies are summarized and
   grouped along the social and temporal dimensions of pride.

Design for Self-Focus Short-Term Pride

   10 out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are both self-focus and
   short-term. The design strategies are distilled into three aspects:
   enhancing self-respect, enhancing self-efficacy, and promoting one’s
   goal achievement.

Enhancing Self-Respect

   Three experience goals indicate that enhancing the feeling of
   self-respect is a pathway to pride experience. Thus, providing users
   with a distinctive interactive tool or workspace and strengthening
   their unique expertise may increase self-awareness of users’ own
   professionalism, which leads to self-respect enhancement. For instance,
   in the Rolls-Royce Marine case introduced above, the salesperson drives
   in front of the customers a special and attractive vehicle that
   demonstrates the same technology in the tugboat steering. This unique
   way of presentation reflects the professional engineering knowledge of
   a tugboat salesperson.

Enhancing Self-Efficacy

   Five experience goals suggest that evoking the feeling of control,
   improvement, and autonomy can enable momentary pride experience. For
   example, providing an overview of all the machines’ data may enhance a
   manager’s feeling of control; boosting performances with a new
   application may enhance a worker’s feeling of competence; providing
   flexible options of the control room layout may enhance an operator’s
   feeling of work autonomy.

Promoting One’s Goal Achievement

   Two experience goals indicate goal achievement promotion may induce
   anticipatory pride. For example, rewarding a learner’s practice of
   welding with a tangible certificate and fueling one’s intrinsic
   interest in doing something desirable may be a pathway to pride
   promotion.

Design for Self-Focus Long-Term Pride

   Seven out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are designed for
   self-focused long-term pride. They stress three aspects: fostering
   self-worth, developing one’s competence, and developing and maintaining
   one’s interest.

Fostering a Sense of Self-Worth

   Three goals indicate that activating one in organizational events,
   letting one work on what one is passionate about, and maintaining a
   positive self-status may foster self-worth, which would thus result in
   a durable self-focused pride. For example, in the case of Konecranes,
   the end users are often invited to a series of organizational events
   that may increase one’s awareness of their own value; making one
   passionate about one's work may result in self-actualization in a
   society; maintaining a decent status in a smooth transfer from work to
   retirement may increase one’s self-esteem.

Developing One’s Competence

   Two goals indicate that challenging one to the next level of skills and
   letting one see how they perform compared to others may produce a
   durable and self-focused pride. In the case of Kemppi, the app provides
   gamification elements and makes the long-term skill improvement
   visible, which may in turn keep learners practicing through enjoyment
   of welding and competition with others.

Developing and Maintaining One’s Interest

   Two goals from two cases indicate that motivating users with rewards as
   in games and keeping users’ inspirations in a series of organizational
   events may result in self-focus long-term pride. In the case of Kemppi,
   the app keeps an update of unlocked features to encourage learners onto
   the next practice level; a company can hold competitions, workshops,
   and seminars to maintain one’s interest and ambition and can thus
   accumulate one’s long-term pride.

Design for Other-Focus Short-Term Pride

   Five out of the 33 pride-related experience goals are both other-focus
   and short-term. They emphasize two aspects: enabling one’s influence in
   social interaction and evoking a sense of belongingness to an
   organization.

Enabling One’s Influence in Social Interaction

   Two experience goals indicate that fueling one’s leadership in social
   interaction and revealing one’s influence on decision-making may result
   in other-focused short-term pride. In the Rolls–Royces case introduced
   above, the special vehicle may guide others’ attention and provide a
   salesperson with a sense of directing, thus facilitate the
   salesperson’s leadership in interacting with the audience. Moreover,
   enabling the customers’ involvement and hence developing awareness of
   their impact on decision-making may build pride in customers through
   social interaction.

Evoking a Sense of Belongingness to an Organization

   Three experience goals indicate that facilitating a connection with
   others, sharing happy moments, and stimulating inspiration and
   appreciation from others may lead to the feeling of other-focus
   short-term pride. For example, the output of an interactive system at
   the entrance of the office may evoke employees’ belongingness to a
   company by worldwide company information dissemination and
   entertainment activity arrangement. Besides this, organizational events
   may have the similar impact on stakeholder engagement by stimulating
   their inspiration.

Design for Other-focus Long-Term Pride

   11 out of the 33 experience goals are designed for other-focus
   long-term pride. These goals focus on two main aspects: fostering a
   sense of belonging to an organization and revealing long-term impacts
   of one’s contribution to others.

Fostering a Sense of Belonging to an Organization

   Six experience goals address the issue that enabling human-to-human
   interaction in organizational events, nurturing organizational
   heritage, and fostering immediate sharing of success may instill a
   sense of belonging to an organization and thus lead to other-focus
   long-term pride. For example, human-to-human interaction at work
   provides the feeling of camaraderie, the appreciation between each
   other, and the historical success of a company, which all contribute to
   collective pride towards an organization.

Revealing the Long-term Impact of One’s Contribution to Others

   Five experience goals indicate that other-focused long-term pride can
   be produced by providing transparency on one's idea development, making
   the positive consequences of one's contributions visible to others, and
   making one’s positive progress visible to others. For example, the
   visualization of a process in which one’s work is further developed and
   implemented by others, and the positive confirmation of one’s critical
   decisions for an organization from a long-term perspective may increase
   one’s stable pride evoked by others.

Discussion

   Workplace as a social space provides a rich context for stimulation,
   development, and maintenance of the dynamics of pride. Design for pride
   in the workplace is a powerful, yet little utilized approach to keeping
   the closed loop of energy up for a successful business. By
   cross-cutting theories from psychology and organizational management,
   this study first introduces the social and temporal dimensions of
   pride. Based on the theoretical framework of pride, the empirical data
   from 20 experience design cases reveals contextualized and concrete
   design strategies for the dynamics of pride experience at work. The
   design implication drawn from these design strategies is given as
   follows.

   The design strategies for self-focused short-term pride is in line with
   the sources of pride in human-production interaction (Desmet 2012):
   self-efficacy enhancement is related to “using the tool induces pride
   of task performance”; self-respect enhancements matches with “owning
   the tool induces pride of one’s expertise”; and goal achievement
   promotion fits with “the tool enables results that induces pride of
   one’s task performance”. To evoke such pride much depends on a
   well-designed momentary interaction between tool and user, for example,
   by measuring and visualizing incremental performance improvement in
   time.

   When moving to a self-focus long-term pride, the design strategies
   adapt to the long-term effect, such as motivation maintenance,
   competence development and fostering self-worth. The key to designing
   for this type of pride is to explore and personalize the individual
   intrinsic meaning and to hold it longer, which is in line with positive
   design for personal significance, i.e., not focusing on the momentary
   effect, but on one’s personal goals and aspirations (Desmet and
   Pohlmeyer 2013).

   Besides the facilitation of work performance enhancement, interactive
   tools can also be designed for other-focused short-term pride to assist
   users’ leadership or involvement in momentary social interaction, such
   as sharing one’s ideas by instant prototyping for collaborative
   discussion. Additionally, seeing others’ responses to one’s
   contribution may happen in organizational events, such as competitions,
   workshops, and seminars. These kinds of events may strengthen one’s
   connection with others, trigger social interaction, and stimulate each
   other’s creativity, in which co-experience of pride can be evoked
   within an organization.

   Other-focused long-term pride is highly related to entrepreneurial
   spirit and loyalty. Company leaders aim to instill such pride into
   their employees and customers. The implications from organizational
   management can enter into design strategy by fostering a sense of
   belonging to an organization through activities (Gouthier and Rhein
   2011). Belongingness is an other-oriented communion, which is about
   sharing common social identity and strengthening interpersonal
   connectedness (Rosso et al. 2010). Thus, sharing a positive identity is
   an important source of the other-focused pride, especially in
   organizational work contexts. Meanwhile, the visualization of progress
   and metrics can enable employees to track their own and others’ work
   (Katzenbach 2003b), and thereby reveal the long-term impact of one’s
   contribution to others, which is also a key design strategy for
   other-focused pride.

   These four types of pride apparently connect to each other and work
   together. For example, one’s pride derived from the pleasure of
   interaction with a work tool may bring out both enjoyment and
   self-enhancement at work. The pleasurable pride may serve as an
   intrinsic motivator for long-term good work performance. The
   visualization of one’s positive work results and progress may evoke
   others’ appreciation. In the long run, the collective impacts of
   everyone’s incremental contribution accumulate and sustain
   organizational success and thereby lead to a durable pride towards
   one’s organization.

   In conclusion, this paper identifies two main trends in designing for
   pride experience in the workplace: designers can uplift their vision
   from self-focused and achievement-oriented interaction with a tool
   towards fostering engagement-oriented interaction with people, and from
   event-based emotional pride in momentary interaction towards a
   long-term organizational attitude of pride. Meanwhile, the role of a
   tool becomes that of an interactive facilitator for co-experience of
   pride in activities rather than the passive means of task completion.

   This study opens the discussion that experience design researchers need
   to study external knowledge in order to broaden the understanding of
   targeted experience, associate multiple dimensions of such experience
   with the design context, and then transfer the constructed knowledge
   into experience design strategy for concept generation.

Limitation and Future Development

   This study is a primary exploration on how to design for a specific
   positive experience in a targeted context. From the study approach
   perspective, the design strategies distilled from the triangulation
   between theories and empirical data were born with considerable
   validity which lies in the traceable evidences from available knowledge
   and concrete design cases. On the other hand, however, the predefined
   four-type-pride framework might limit the variety of the strategies,
   because there might be valuable special strategies that could be
   excluded by the scope of this framework. This limitation reflects that
   it could be a danger if designers overly rely on the available
   strategies and thus they might be restricted by the structured
   framework. In this sense, these identified patterns should serve more
   for understanding, inspiring and framing new themes, instead of fixing
   designers’ mindset.

   From the data perspective, it is based on the collection of 20 student
   design cases in one design department from 2012 to 2015, which
   determines the specificity and limitation of this study. The
   interference between different design teams and the bias influenced by
   the earlier cases may be hardly avoided in the design process, which
   may lead to limitations of experience goal setting and idea generation.
   Although the fresh eyes of students may generate novel ideas and
   explore new possibilities, their limited breadth of mature design
   experience for the workplace may also result in some shallow design
   concepts. Moreover, a 2-month project can hardly include a long-term
   evaluation of design results.

   From the finding validity perspective, the pride experience design
   strategies were presented as backup tools in the latest course but
   without guiding the students to use them. Compared with previous cases,
   pride was defined more towards durable pride and organizational pride
   in the recent cases. More importantly, inspired by these cases, the
   companies have gradually changed their mindset from focusing on
   usability towards prioritizing experience, and have recognized pride
   can be designed from not only interaction quality in task but also
   organizational impact. This impact was manifested in the industrial
   seminar when two companies presented and referred the student cases as
   their new path to experience design innovation. At least one
   design-for-pride case was implemented entirely from the students’
   concepts, and got positive feedback from the company’s clients.

   Future studies will focus on at least three directions. First, it is
   worth adding case diversity to the data collection: cases from
   different programs in different research institutes or companies are
   needed for both qualitative and quantitative studies to assess whether
   the two dimensions of design for pride can be applied to a large number
   of design cases. Second, there is a definite need to trace the real
   implementation of certain strategies in the client companies to
   identify the long-term impact on both workers’ subjective wellbeing and
   business development. Third, it is also meaningful to observe designing
   for pride in other domains and to identify what kind of strategies are
   common patterns and to what degree the differences of contexts lead to
   the specificity of design strategies.

Chapter I

   IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
   of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

   However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
   first entering a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
   of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
   property of some one or other of their daughters.

   “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard
   that Netherfield Park is let at last?”

   Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she, “for
   Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”

   Mr. Bennet made no answer.

   “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife,
   impatiently.

   “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”

   This was invitation enough.

   “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
   by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
   down on Monday in a chaise-and-four to see the place, and was so much
   delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
   is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are
   to be in the house by the end of next week.”

   “What is his name?”

   “Bingley.”

   “Is he married or single?”

   “Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune—four or
   five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”

   “How so? How can it affect them?”

   “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome?
   You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

   “Is that his design in settling here?”

   “Design? nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
   may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
   soon as he comes.”

   “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
   them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
   as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
   party.”

   “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but
   I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
   five grownup daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
   beauty.”

   “In such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”

   “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes
   into the neighborhood.”

   “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”

   “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
   be for one of them! Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
   merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no
   new-comers. Indeed, you must go, for it will be impossible for us to
   visit him, if you do not.”

   “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
   glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
   hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls;
   though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”

   “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
   others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
   good-humored as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”

   “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he. “They are
   all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more
   of quickness than her sisters.”

   “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
   take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”

   “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
   are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
   these twenty years at least.”

   “Ah, you do not know what I suffer!”

   “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of
   four thousand a year come into the neighborhood.”

   “It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not
   visit them.”

   “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them
   all.” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick tarts, sarcastic humor,
   reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
   been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind
   was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
   little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
   she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
   daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
   Chapter II

Footnotes

    1. Having “poor nerves” in this case suggests that Mrs. Bennet is
       inclined to have panic attacks; however, she clearly uses her
       nervousness to control other people. If things do not go her way,
       she becomes something of a hypochondriac who suffers from more than
       just anxiety: “‘Ah,” as she says to Mr. Bennet, “‘you do not know
       what I suffer!’” To her, nervousness is almost a sort of illness.
       She uses this “illness” to manipulate others because she expects
       them to do whatever it takes to make her feel better.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    2. “Abuse” in this case means speaking against or putting down as
       opposed to physical abuse. Of course, Mrs. Bennet is being
       hypocritical; though Mr. Bennet has openly favored Elizabeth over
       his other daughters, Mrs. Bennet has just done the same thing by
       favoring Jane and Lydia.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    3. Mr. Bennet is being prideful but not as obviously as Mrs. Bennet.
       His refusal to take Mrs. Bennet seriously suggests that he feels he
       is above (or too good for) his wife’s concerns. When she urges him
       to visit Mr. Bingley for the sake of his daughters, he tells her
       that she and the girls should go on their own—which would have been
       quite scandalous—and jokes that Mr. Bingley would probably prefer
       Mrs. Bennet.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    4. The themes of pride and prejudice have already begun to take shape
       in Mrs. Bennet’s character by the end of the first chapter. For
       example, she exhibits prideful behavior when she implies that her
       daughters are more deserving of Mr. Bingley than other eligible
       daughters in the neighborhood. She is also being prejudicial
       because she believes other girls, such as the Lucases, are inferior
       to her daughters—though she doesn’t have any real reason for
       thinking this way.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    5. “Bingley” is the name of one of a town in northern England that
       prospered during the Industrial Revolution.Though we are not told
       whether Mr. Bingley comes from Bingley the town, his name strongly
       associates him with the growth of industrial manufacturing. This
       further supports our identification of the Bingleys with the
       nouveau riche (newly rich people who made their fortunes from
       trade) because they probably made their money from manufacturing.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    6. Austen may have chosen the name “Netherfield” because the Bingleys
       are not truly aristocratic. They acquired wealth through trade, so
       they would have been considered nouveau riche: newly rich people
       who are not actually part of the aristocracy (the highest social
       class besides royalty). The nouveau riche were controversial in
       Austen’s time because, though they had a lot of money, they were
       not members of the noble landed gentry that passed down their
       wealth over centuries.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    7. Netherfield Park is a fictional estate located in Hertfordshire, a
       county just north of London. “Nether” means “lower” or “lower in
       position,” so it’s a strange choice for a wealthy man like Mr.
       Bingley.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    8. “Caprice” means an unpredictable or inconsistent change of mood,
       behavior, or opinion. Mr. Bennet is capricious because his feelings
       and thoughts tend to change without apparent reason, sometimes on a
       whim.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
    9. Michaelmas is the Christian Feast of St. Michael and All Angels (as
       it is traditionally named by the Anglican Church). St. Michael is
       one of the primary angelic warriors who fought against Satan and is
       considered a protector against the darkness of night. It was
       believed that evil, or at least negative energy, intensified in the
       dark. Families would therefore require strength during the darker
       months of the year, so Michaelmas is celebrated (in Western
       churches) on September 29—right as the days begin to noticeably
       shorten. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Feast usually celebrates
       Saints Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and the archangels.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
   10. A “chaise-and-four” is a carriage (or chaise) that is drawn by four
       horses. It was a standard mode of transportation for families that
       were well-off, though not extraordinarily wealthy. The fact that
       Mr. Bingley owns a chaise-and-four indicates that he is both
       financially stable and socially respectable.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
   11. That is, Mrs. Bennet’s priorities and interests are fairly trivial.
       Though her instinct to secure sensible marriages for her daughters
       is well-founded, it does not seem to be based on intelligent
       reflection. Instead, she just seems self-involved and silly.
       — Sarah, Owl Eyes Staff
   12. Mrs. Bennet is not an intelligent or perceptive person; instead,
       she is concerned with frivolous things like neighborhood gossip,
       parties, and other social matters. Her shallowness contributes to
       her lack of self-awareness in social situations—or even in her own
       family.
       — Stephen Holliday
   13. The word “mean” is being used here to describe something average,
       mediocre, or unremarkable. Though the word is not always negative,
       it is clearly being used to disparage Mrs. Bennet: she is
       small-minded and unable to understand anything particularly
       complicated. Interestingly, she does seem to understand that her
       daughters will be financially destitute if they do not marry men
       like Mr. Bingley (men who are respectable and well-off).
       — Stephen Holliday
   14. In other words, Mrs. Bennet's mind is not as complicated or
       difficult to understand as Mr. Bennet’s. Though she has an
       “uncertain temper,” her opinions and behaviors are otherwise a lot
       more consistent and predictable.
       — Stephen Holliday
   15. Four thousand pounds a year is roughly equivalent to $400,000 US
       dollars. Trying to understand the current buying power of currency
       in Austen’s day is difficult. However, from a literary standpoint,
       buying power is not as important as Austen’s overall message that
       it is important to have a comfortable level of wealth.
       — Stephen Holliday
   16. Michaelmas is also one of the English quarter days—one of four days
       each year on which servants are hired and rents are due. The other
       three quarter days are Lady Day (March 25), Midsummer Day (June
       24), and Christmas Day (December 25).
       — Stephen Holliday
   17. The initial comic exchange that arises between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet
       provides us with an early allusion to the themes that directly
       relate to the novel’s title. While “pride” and “prejudice”
       certainly figure prominently (and in more complex ways) later on,
       Mr. Bennet is here shown to be detached and prideful while Mrs.
       Bennet is completely prejudicial.
       — Jamie Wheeler
   18. This humorous, tongue-in-cheek beginning sets the tone for the
       entire novel. Though it often deals with serious issues, such as
       the financial dependency of women in a patriarchal society, the
       novel is generally lighter fare than other Austen novels: as Austen
       herself admits in a personal letter, it is “rather too light, and
       bright, and sparkling.”
       — Jamie Wheeler

Chapter 1

   It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
   of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

   However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
   first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the
   minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful
   property of some one or other of their daughters.

   “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard
   that Netherfield Park is let at last?”

   Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

   “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
   told me all about it.”

   Mr. Bennet made no answer.

   “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.

   “YOU want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”

   This was invitation enough.

   “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
   by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
   down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
   delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
   is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are
   to be in the house by the end of next week.”

   “What is his name?”

   “Bingley.”

   “Is he married or single?”

   “Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four
   or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”

   “How so? How can it affect them?”

   “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome!
   You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

   “Is that his design in settling here?”

   “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
   MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
   soon as he comes.”

   “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
   them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
   as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
   party.”

   “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty, but
   I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
   five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
   beauty.”

   “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”

   “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes
   into the neighbourhood.”

   “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”

   “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
   be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
   merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
   newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to
   visit him if you do not.”

   “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
   glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
   hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls;
   though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”

   “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
   others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
   good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving HER the preference.”

   “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
   all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more
   of quickness than her sisters.”

   “Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way? You
   take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”

   “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
   are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
   these last twenty years at least.”

   Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
   reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
   been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. HER mind
   was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
   little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
   she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
   daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

Chapter 2

   Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.
   He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
   his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit
   was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the
   following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a
   hat, he suddenly addressed her with:

   “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”

   “We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
   resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”

   “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
   assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”

   “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
   of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
   of her.”

   “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
   not depend on her serving you.”

   Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
   herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

   “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little
   compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”

   “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
   them ill.”

   “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When
   is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”

   “To-morrow fortnight.”

   “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back
   till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
   for she will not know him herself.”

   “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
   introduce Mr. Bingley to HER.”

   “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
   myself; how can you be so teasing?”

   “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
   very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
   fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
   Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
   she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
   take it on myself.”

   The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
   nonsense!”

   “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
   you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
   them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you THERE. What say you,
   Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
   great books and make extracts.”

   Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

   “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to
   Mr. Bingley.”

   “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.

   “I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before? If I
   had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
   him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
   cannot escape the acquaintance now.”

   The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
   Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of
   joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected
   all the while.

   “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
   persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
   neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
   good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
   word about it till now.”

   “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet;
   and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his
   wife.

   “What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
   shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his
   kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not
   so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day;
   but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you
   ARE the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the
   next ball.”

   “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I AM the
   youngest, I’m the tallest.”

   The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
   return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
   dinner.

Chapter 3

   Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
   daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
   husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
   in various ways–with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
   distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
   last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
   Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
   delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
   agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
   with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
   dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
   hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.

   “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
   said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
   married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”

   In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about
   ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
   admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
   much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
   fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
   window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

   An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
   Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
   housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
   was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
   to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
   disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
   so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
   he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
   settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
   a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a
   large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
   was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the
   assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were
   comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he
   brought only six with him from London–his five sisters and a cousin.
   And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
   altogether–Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
   another young man.

   Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
   countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
   with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
   looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
   of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien,
   and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
   after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
   pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
   much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
   admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
   which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
   proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
   his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
   forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
   with his friend.

   Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
   people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
   was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
   himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
   themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy
   danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined
   being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening
   in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own
   party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most
   disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never
   come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,
   whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular
   resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.

   Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
   down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
   standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
   Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
   to join it.

   “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
   standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
   dance.”

   “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
   particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it
   would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
   another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
   stand up with.”

   “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
   kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
   life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
   uncommonly pretty.”

   “YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
   Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

   “Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
   of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
   dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”

   “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
   Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
   “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt ME; I am in no
   humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
   by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
   smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”

   Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
   remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
   however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
   playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

   The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
   Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
   party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
   distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her
   mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s
   pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
   accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had
   been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that
   they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in
   good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which
   they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up.
   With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he
   had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had
   raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s
   views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that
   he had a different story to hear.

   “Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
   delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
   Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
   she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced
   with her twice! Only think of THAT, my dear; he actually danced with
   her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a
   second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see
   him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all;
   indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as
   she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got
   introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he
   danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two
   fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the
   BOULANGER–“

   “If he had had any compassion for ME,” cried her husband impatiently,
   “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
   his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!”

   “Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
   handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
   anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
   Hurst’s gown–“

   Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
   description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
   of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
   exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

   “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by
   not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not
   at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no
   enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so
   very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been
   there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest
   the man.”

Chapter 4

   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious
   in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how
   very much she admired him.

   “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
   good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!–so much
   ease, with such perfect good breeding!”

   “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
   likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”

   “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
   did not expect such a compliment.”

   “Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
   us. Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and ME never. What could
   be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing
   that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the
   room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very
   agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
   stupider person.”

   “Dear Lizzy!”

   “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
   You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
   in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
   life.”

   “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
   what I think.”

   “I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder. With YOUR good
   sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
   Affectation of candour is common enough–one meets with it everywhere.
   But to be candid without ostentation or design–to take the good of
   everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the
   bad–belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do
   you? Their manners are not equal to his.”

   “Certainly not–at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
   converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
   his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
   neighbour in her.”

   Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour
   at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with
   more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her
   sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to
   herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in
   fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were
   pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they
   chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been
   educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune
   of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they
   ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in
   every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of
   others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a
   circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their
   brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.

   Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
   thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
   estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise,
   and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided
   with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many
   of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not
   spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next
   generation to purchase.

   His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
   though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
   means unwilling to preside at his table–nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
   married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
   his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
   age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
   look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
   half-an-hour–was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms,
   satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
   immediately.

   Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
   great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
   easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
   could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
   never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
   had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In
   understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
   deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
   reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
   inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
   was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
   giving offense.

   The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
   characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
   prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
   to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
   acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
   conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
   collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion,
   for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none
   received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to
   be pretty, but she smiled too much.

   Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so–but still they admired
   her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
   they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
   established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
   commendation to think of her as he chose.

Chapter 5

   Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
   were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in
   trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to
   the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his
   mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had
   given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small
   market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family
   to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period
   Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance,
   and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to
   all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
   supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
   nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
   James’s had made him courteous.

   Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
   valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
   eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
   twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.

   That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
   ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
   brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

   “YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
   self-command to Miss Lucas. “YOU were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”

   “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”

   “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
   sure that DID seem as if he admired her–indeed I rather believe he
   DID–I heard something about it–but I hardly know what–something about
   Mr. Robinson.”

   “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did
   not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our
   Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great
   many pretty women in the room, and WHICH he thought the prettiest? and
   his answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss
   Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'”

   “Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed–that does seem as
   if–but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”

   “MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS, Eliza,” said
   Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
   is he?–poor Eliza!–to be only just TOLERABLE.”

   “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
   ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be
   quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night
   that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his
   lips.”

   “Are you quite sure, ma’am?–is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
   “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”

   “Aye–because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
   could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
   being spoke to.”

   “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, unless
   among his intimate acquaintances. With THEM he is remarkably
   agreeable.”

   “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
   agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
   was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
   heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
   the ball in a hack chaise.”

   “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
   wish he had danced with Eliza.”

   “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with HIM, if
   I were you.”

   “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him.”

   “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend ME so much as pride
   often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that
   so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his
   favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has
   a RIGHT to be proud.”

   “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive HIS
   pride, if he had not mortified MINE.”

   “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
   reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
   ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
   nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
   who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
   quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
   things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be
   proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
   ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”

   “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with
   his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
   foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”

   “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
   Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
   directly.”

   The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that
   she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

Chapter 6

   The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
   was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on
   the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
   found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
   a wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards the
   two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
   pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
   of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like
   them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as
   arising in all probability from the influence of their brother’s
   admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID
   admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to
   the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first,
   and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with
   pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in
   general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure
   of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her
   from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her
   friend Miss Lucas.

   “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
   on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
   so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
   from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
   it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
   the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
   attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
   BEGIN freely–a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very
   few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
   encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show MORE
   affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
   may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”

   “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
   perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
   discover it too.”

   “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”

   “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
   it, he must find it out.”

   “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and
   Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as
   they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible
   that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane
   should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can
   command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more
   leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”

   “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
   question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
   to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.
   But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
   she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
   reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
   dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
   and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
   enough to make her understand his character.”

   “Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she might only
   have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember
   that four evenings have also been spent together–and four evenings may
   do a great deal.”

   “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
   like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
   leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

   “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
   she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
   chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
   twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
   the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
   ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
   least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
   have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
   possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
   life.”

   “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
   sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”

   Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
   was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
   interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
   allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at
   the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.
   But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she
   hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was
   rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark
   eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
   Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of
   perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure
   to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her
   manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their
   easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only
   the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her
   handsome enough to dance with.

   He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
   with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing
   so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party
   were assembled.

   “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
   conversation with Colonel Forster?”

   “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”

   “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
   what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
   being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”

   On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
   any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
   a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
   turned to him and said:

   “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
   just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
   Meryton?”

   “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
   energetic.”

   “You are severe on us.”

   “It will be HER turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
   to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”

   “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!–always wanting me
   to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
   musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
   really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
   hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering,
   however, she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely
   glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody
   here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your
   porridge’; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”

   Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
   or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
   she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by
   her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one
   in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was
   always impatient for display.

   Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
   application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
   manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
   had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
   much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
   end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
   Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with
   some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
   dancing at one end of the room.

   Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
   passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
   much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
   his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

   “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
   is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
   refinements of polished society.”

   “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
   amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can
   dance.”

   Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
   continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
   not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”

   “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”

   “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.
   Do you often dance at St. James’s?”

   “Never, sir.”

   “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”

   “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”

   “You have a house in town, I conclude?”

   Mr. Darcy bowed.

   “I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself–for I am fond of
   superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
   London would agree with Lady Lucas.”

   He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
   make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
   struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
   her:

   “My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
   me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
   cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”
   And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
   extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she
   instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

   “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
   not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”

   Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
   her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
   all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

   “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
   me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
   amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
   for one half-hour.”

   “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.

   “He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
   cannot wonder at his complaisance–for who would object to such a
   partner?”

   Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
   injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
   complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

   “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”

   “I should imagine not.”

   “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
   evenings in this manner–in such society; and indeed I am quite of your
   opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
   noise–the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!
   What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”

   “You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
   agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
   which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”

   Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
   would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
   Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

   “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”

   “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
   How long has she been such a favourite?–and pray, when am I to wish you
   joy?”

   “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
   imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
   to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”

   “Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
   absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law,
   indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”

   He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
   entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
   that all was safe, her wit flowed long.

Chapter 7

   Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
   thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
   in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
   fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
   the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
   had left her four thousand pounds.

   She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
   their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled
   in London in a respectable line of trade.

   The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
   convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
   thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
   to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
   Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
   their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
   better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
   hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of
   news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
   some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
   with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
   the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
   the headquarters.

   Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
   interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
   of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
   secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
   Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
   felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
   Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to
   their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
   regimentals of an ensign.

   After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
   Bennet coolly observed:

   “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
   of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time,
   but I am now convinced.”

   Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
   indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
   and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going
   the next morning to London.

   “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
   ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
   slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,
   however.”

   “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”

   “Yes–but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”

   “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
   had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
   so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters
   uncommonly foolish.”

   “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense
   of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they
   will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time
   when I liked a red coat myself very well–and, indeed, so I do still at
   my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a
   year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I
   thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir
   William’s in his regimentals.”

   “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
   Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first
   came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”

   Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
   a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant
   waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and
   she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

   “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
   Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”

   “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.

   “MY DEAR FRIEND,–

   “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
   we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
   for a whole day’s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
   quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
   gentlemen are to dine with the officers.–Yours ever,

   “CAROLINE BINGLEY”

   “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
   THAT.”

   “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”

   “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.

   “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely
   to rain; and then you must stay all night.”

   “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
   they would not offer to send her home.”

   “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton,
   and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”

   “I had much rather go in the coach.”

   “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
   wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”

   “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”

   “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
   will be answered.”

   She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the
   horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and
   her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
   bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
   rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
   delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
   Jane certainly could not come back.

   “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than
   once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
   next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
   contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from
   Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:

   “MY DEAREST LIZZY,–

   “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
   imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
   hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing
   Mr. Jones–therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having
   been to me–and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much
   the matter with me.–Yours, etc.”

   “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
   aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness–if she
   should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
   Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”

   “Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
   colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it
   is all very well. I would go an see her if I could have the carriage.”

   Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
   the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
   was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

   “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
   thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
   there.”

   “I shall be very fit to see Jane–which is all I want.”

   “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
   horses?”

   “No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
   when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”

   “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
   impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
   exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”

   “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
   Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
   together.

   “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
   see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”

   In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of
   one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone,
   crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and
   springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at
   last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and
   a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.

   She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
   assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
   That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
   dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
   Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in
   contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and
   in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness;
   there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
   Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
   brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to
   the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
   thinking only of his breakfast.

   Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
   Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
   enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
   immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
   alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
   for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
   however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
   together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
   extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently
   attended her.

   When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
   began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
   solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
   examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
   violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
   advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The
   advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and
   her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment;
   nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they
   had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

   When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
   unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she
   only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such
   concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert
   the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for
   the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
   dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring
   back a supply of clothes.

Chapter 8

   At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
   Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
   poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
   much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very
   favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
   this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
   shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
   being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
   indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
   Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.

   Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
   regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
   attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
   herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
   others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
   engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
   Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
   eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
   dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

   When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
   began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
   pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
   she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
   same, and added:

   “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
   walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
   looked almost wild.”

   “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
   nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE be scampering about the
   country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so
   blowsy!”

   “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
   in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down
   to hide it not doing its office.”

   “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
   all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
   well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat
   quite escaped my notice.”

   “YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
   inclined to think that you would not wish to see YOUR sister make such
   an exhibition.”

   “Certainly not.”

   “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
   above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean
   by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited
   independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”

   “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
   Bingley.

   “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper,
   “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
   eyes.”

   “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
   short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

   “I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
   sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But
   with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid
   there is no chance of it.”

   “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on
   Meryton.”

   “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”

   “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

   “If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
   would not make them one jot less agreeable.”

   “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
   consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.

   To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
   hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
   their dear friend’s vulgar relations.

   With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
   leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
   She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all,
   till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep,
   and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
   downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
   party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
   them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
   excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
   below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

   “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”

   “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
   reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”

   “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I
   am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”

   “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley;
   “and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”

   Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table
   where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
   others–all that his library afforded.

   “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
   credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have
   more than I ever looked into.”

   Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
   in the room.

   “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
   so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
   Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”

   “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
   generations.”

   “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
   books.”

   “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
   these.”

   “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
   that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR house, I wish it may be
   half as delightful as Pemberley.”

   “I wish it may.”

   “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
   neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
   finer county in England than Derbyshire.”

   “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”

   “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”

   “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
   Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”

   Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
   little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she
   drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and
   his eldest sister, to observe the game.

   “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
   she be as tall as I am?”

   “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
   rather taller.”

   “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
   so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely
   accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is
   exquisite.”

   “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have
   patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”

   “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”

   “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
   net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am
   sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
   being informed that she was very accomplished.”

   “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
   too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
   otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
   far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
   cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of
   my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”

   “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.

   “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
   idea of an accomplished woman.”

   “Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”

   “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
   esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
   with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing,
   drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and
   besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and
   manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions,
   or the word will be but half-deserved.”

   “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet
   add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
   extensive reading.”

   “I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six accomplished women.
   I rather wonder now at your knowing ANY.”

   “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
   this?”

   “I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
   application, and elegance, as you describe united.”

   Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
   implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
   answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
   bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As
   all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left
   the room.

   “Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
   “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
   other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
   succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”

   “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
   addressed, “there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies sometimes
   condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to
   cunning is despicable.”

   Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
   continue the subject.

   Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
   that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
   immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
   be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
   eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
   unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
   that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
   were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
   declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
   however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
   his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
   attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

Chapter 9

   Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in
   the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer
   to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a
   housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who
   waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she
   requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to
   visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was
   immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs.
   Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon
   after the family breakfast.

   Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
   very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
   not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
   restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
   would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being
   carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same
   time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with
   Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three
   daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them
   with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she
   expected.

   “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to
   be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must
   trespass a little longer on your kindness.”

   “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
   sure, will not hear of her removal.”

   “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
   “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
   remains with us.”

   Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

   “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not
   know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
   a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
   always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
   temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
   nothing to HER. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming
   prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country
   that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a
   hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”

   “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
   should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
   minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”

   “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.

   “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.

   “Oh! yes–I understand you perfectly.”

   “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
   through I am afraid is pitiful.”

   “That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
   character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”

   “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on
   in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”

   “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that your were
   a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”

   “Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They have at least
   that advantage.”

   “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects
   for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very
   confined and unvarying society.”

   “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
   observed in them for ever.”

   “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
   a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of THAT
   going on in the country as in town.”

   Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
   turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a
   complete victory over him, continued her triumph.

   “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
   my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
   pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”

   “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
   when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
   advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”

   “Aye–that is because you have the right disposition. But that
   gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
   at all.”

   “Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
   mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
   such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
   which you must acknowledge to be true.”

   “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
   many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
   neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”

   Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
   countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes
   towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake
   of saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked
   her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since HER coming away.

   “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
   William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
   genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. THAT is
   my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
   important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”

   “Did Charlotte dine with you?”

   “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
   For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own
   work; MY daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
   judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
   assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
   Charlotte so VERY plain–but then she is our particular friend.”

   “She seems a very pleasant young woman.”

   “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
   has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
   of my own child, but to be sure, Jane–one does not often see anybody
   better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
   partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
   Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
   sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
   did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some
   verses on her, and very pretty they were.”

   “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has
   been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
   discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”

   “I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,” said Darcy.

   “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
   strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
   am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”

   Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
   tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
   speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence
   Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness
   to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley
   was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to
   be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her
   part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied,
   and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the
   youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been
   whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it
   was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on
   his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

   Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
   and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
   affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
   animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
   attention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her
   own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
   very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
   ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would
   be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His
   answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:

   “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
   your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day
   of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”

   Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes–it would be much better to
   wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
   would be at Meryton again. And when you have given YOUR ball,” she
   added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
   Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”

   Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
   instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
   remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
   could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of
   all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on FINE EYES.

Chapter 10

   The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
   Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
   continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
   their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not
   appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was
   watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his
   attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at
   piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

   Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
   attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
   commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the
   evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect
   unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious
   dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.

   “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”

   He made no answer.

   “You write uncommonly fast.”

   “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”

   “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
   year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”

   “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”

   “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”

   “I have already told her so once, by your desire.”

   “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
   pens remarkably well.”

   “Thank you–but I always mend my own.”

   “How can you contrive to write so even?”

   He was silent.

   “Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the
   harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her
   beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior
   to Miss Grantley’s.”

   “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
   present I have not room to do them justice.”

   “Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
   always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”

   “They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
   to determine.”

   “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
   ease, cannot write ill.”

   “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
   brother, “because he does NOT write with ease. He studies too much for
   words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”

   “My style of writing is very different from yours.”

   “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
   imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”

   “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them–by which
   means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
   correspondents.”

   “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”

   “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
   humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
   indirect boast.”

   “And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty?”

   “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
   writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
   thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
   think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
   quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
   attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
   Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
   you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
   panegyric, of compliment to yourself–and yet what is there so very
   laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
   undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”

   “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
   foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
   I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
   moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
   precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”

   “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
   would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
   dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
   mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better
   stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not
   go–and at another word, might stay a month.”

   “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
   not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
   more than he did himself.”

   “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
   friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
   afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
   intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
   circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
   could.”

   “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
   as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”

   “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak
   for himself.”

   “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
   but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
   stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
   that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
   the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
   one argument in favour of its propriety.”

   “To yield readily–easily–to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with
   you.”

   “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
   either.”

   “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
   friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
   one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
   one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
   supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
   circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
   thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
   where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
   very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
   with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”

   “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
   arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
   appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
   between the parties?”

   “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
   forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
   weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
   you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison
   with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I
   do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions,
   and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday
   evening, when he has nothing to do.”

   Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
   rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
   resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
   brother for talking such nonsense.

   “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an
   argument, and want to silence this.”

   “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
   Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
   thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”

   “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
   Darcy had much better finish his letter.”

   Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

   When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
   for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
   to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would
   lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived,
   she seated herself.

   Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
   Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
   that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
   on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
   admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
   because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only
   imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was
   something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of
   right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain
   her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.

   After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
   lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
   Elizabeth, said to her:

   “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
   opportunity of dancing a reel?”

   She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
   surprise at her silence.

   “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately
   determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
   that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
   delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
   their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
   you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all–and now despise me if
   you dare.”

   “Indeed I do not dare.”

   Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
   gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
   manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
   had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
   believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
   should be in some danger.

   Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
   anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
   assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

   She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking
   of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an
   alliance.

   “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
   next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
   desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
   and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after
   officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
   check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
   which your lady possesses.”

   “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”

   “Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be
   placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle
   the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
   lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for
   what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”

   “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
   colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
   copied.”

   At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
   Elizabeth herself.

   “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
   confusion, lest they had been overheard.

   “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away
   without telling us that you were coming out.”

   Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
   by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their
   rudeness, and immediately said:

   “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
   avenue.”

   But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
   laughingly answered:

   “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
   uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
   fourth. Good-bye.”

   She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
   being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
   as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.

Chapter 11

   When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
   and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
   drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
   professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
   as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen
   appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could
   describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with
   humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.

   But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
   Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,

   Pride and Prejudice is the second novel by English author Jane Austen,
   published in 1813. A novel of manners, it follows the character
   development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who
   learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to
   appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual
   goodness.

   Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five
   daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a
   male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces
   becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one
   of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a
   motivation that drives the plot.

   Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of
   "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. It
   has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with
   over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in
   modern literature.^[1]^[2] For more than a century, dramatic
   adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of
   Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes
   of the novel, reaching mass audiences.^[3]

Plot summary[edit]

   [220px-PrideandPrejudiceCH3.jpg] Mr Darcy says Elizabeth is "not
   handsome enough to tempt him" to dance. (Artist: C.E. Brock, 1895)

   In the early 19th century, the Bennet family live at their Longbourn
   estate, situated near the village of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England.
   Mrs Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to
   secure their futures.

   The arrival of Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring
   Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might
   contract an advantageous marriage, because "It is a truth universally
   acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must
   be in want of a wife".

   At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including
   Mr Bingley, his two sisters and Mr Darcy, his dearest friend. Mr
   Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the
   guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr
   Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr Bingley, is haughty and
   aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with
   Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is "not handsome
   enough". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is
   deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr Darcy secretly
   begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter
   each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.

   Mr Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family
   with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the
   advice of his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be
   Mr Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meet
   the charming army officer George Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in
   confidence about Mr Darcy's unpleasant treatment of him in the past.
   Elizabeth, blinded by her prejudice toward Mr Darcy, believes him.

   Elizabeth dances with Mr Darcy at a ball, where Mrs Bennet hints loudly
   that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects
   Mr Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's
   relief. Mr Collins instead proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of
   Elizabeth.

   Having heard Mrs Bennet's words at the ball and disapproving of the
   marriage, Mr Darcy joins Mr Bingley in a trip to London and, with the
   help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A
   heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise
   her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr Darcy grows as she
   suspects he was responsible for Mr Bingley's departure.

   Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia
   and Wickham, in one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and
   Prejudice.^[4] The clothing styles reflect the time the illustration
   was engraved (the 1830s), not the time in which the novel was written
   or set.

   In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent.
   Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's
   home. Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting
   Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy recently saved a
   friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth
   realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane.

   Mr Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her
   low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr
   Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last
   person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who
   caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating
   Wickham unjustly. Mr Darcy brags about his success in separating
   Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding
   Wickham without addressing it.

   The next day, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that
   Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the "living"
   his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it.
   Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's
   15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr Darcy
   also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her
   indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed
   by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her
   own prejudice against Mr Darcy.

   Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of
   Derbyshire. They visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate. When Mr Darcy returns
   unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the
   Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond
   of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news
   that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr Darcy,
   then departs in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to
   marry Lydia. She visits the family and tells Elizabeth that Mr Darcy
   was at her wedding. Though Mr Darcy had sworn everyone involved to
   secrecy, Mrs Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he
   secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

   Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr
   Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth
   intends to marry Mr Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to
   accept Mr Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already
   planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks
   the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's
   indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and
   is accepted.

     * Elizabeth Bennet – the second-eldest of the Bennet daughters, she
       is attractive, witty and intelligent – but with a tendency to form
       tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story
       progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of
       Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy
       overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading
       them both to surrender to their love for each other.
     * Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy – Mr Bingley's friend and the wealthy owner of
       the family estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, rumoured to be worth
       at least £10,000 a year. While he is handsome, tall, and
       intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and social graces, and so others
       frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof of
       excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the novel,
       he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest. Though he
       appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this
       reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.
     * Mr Bennet – A logical and reasonable late-middle-aged landed
       gentleman of a more modest income of £2,000 per annum, and the
       dryly sarcastic patriarch of the now-dwindling Bennet family, with
       five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, is entailed to the
       male line. His affection for his wife wore off early in their
       marriage and is now reduced to mere toleration. He is often
       described as 'indolent' in the novel.
     * Mrs Bennet (née Gardiner) – the middle-aged wife of Mr Bennet, and
       the mother of their five daughters. Mrs Bennet is a hypochondriac
       who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and
       palpitations (her "poor nerves") whenever things are not going her
       way. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to
       wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her
       daughters happiness is of little concern to her. She was settled a
       dowry of £4,000 from her father.

   [220px-William_Blake_Mrs_Q_1820_engraving_after_Francois_Huet_Villiers_
   The_British_Museum.jpg] In a letter to Cassandra dated May 1813, Jane
   Austen describes a picture she saw at a gallery which was a good
   likeness of "Mrs Bingley" – Jane Bennet. Deirdre Le Faye in The World
   of Her Novels suggests that "Portrait of Mrs Q" is the picture Austen
   was referring to. (pp. 201–203)
     * Jane Bennet – the eldest Bennet sister. She is considered the most
       beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is inclined to see
       only the good in others (but can be persuaded otherwise on
       sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a
       rich young gentleman recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close
       friend of Mr Darcy.
     * Mary Bennet – the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of her
       siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and plays
       music, although she is often impatient to display her
       accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently
       moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's A
       Memoir of Jane Austen, Mary ended up marrying one of her Uncle
       Philips' law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.
     * Catherine "Kitty" Bennet – the fourth Bennet daughter. Though older
       than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the
       officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia
       and is described as a "silly" young woman. However, it is said that
       she improved when removed from Lydia's influence. According to
       James Edward Austen-Leigh's A Memoir of Jane Austen, Kitty later
       married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.
     * Lydia Bennet – the youngest Bennet sister. She is frivolous and
       headstrong. Her main activity in life is socialising, especially
       flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to her
       running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention of
       marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her
       society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she "feels without
       reasoning".^[5]

     * Charles Bingley – a handsome, amiable, wealthy young gentleman from
       the north of England, who leases Netherfield Park, an estate three
       miles from Longbourn, with the hopes of purchasing it. He is
       contrasted with Mr Darcy for having more generally pleasing
       manners, although he is reliant on his more experienced friend for
       advice. An example of this is the prevention of Bingley and Jane's
       romance because of Bingley's undeniable dependence on Darcy's
       opinion.^[6] He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others;
       his two sisters, Miss Caroline Bingley and Mrs Louisa Hurst, both
       disapprove of Bingley's growing affection for Miss Jane Bennet. He
       inherited a fortune of £100,000.^[7]

     * Caroline Bingley – the vainglorious, snobbish sister of Charles
       Bingley, with a fortune of £20,000. Miss Bingley harbours designs
       upon Mr Darcy, and therefore is jealous of his growing attachment
       to Elizabeth. She attempts to dissuade Mr Darcy from liking
       Elizabeth by ridiculing the Bennet family and criticising
       Elizabeth's comportment. Miss Bingley also disapproves of her
       brother's esteem for Jane Bennet, and is disdainful of society in
       Meryton. Her wealth and her expensive education seem to be the two
       greatest sources of Miss Bingley's vanity and conceit; likewise,
       she is very insecure about the fact that her and her family's money
       all comes from trade, and is eager both for her brother to purchase
       an estate, elevating the Bingleys to the ranks of the gentry, and
       for herself to marry a landed gentleman. The dynamic between Miss
       Bingley and her sister, Louisa Hurst, seems to echo that of Lydia
       and Kitty Bennet, and of Mrs Bennet and Mrs Phillips, in that one
       sister of the pair is no more than a follower of the other:
       Caroline occupies the same position as Lydia does with Kitty, and
       Louisa the same position as Mrs Bennet with Mrs Phillips (though,
       in Louisa's case, as she is already married, she is not under the
       same pressure as Caroline). Louisa is married to Mr Hurst, who has
       a house in Grosvenor Square, London.
     * George Wickham – Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy since
       infancy, being the son of Mr Darcy's father's steward. An officer
       in the militia, he is superficially charming and rapidly forms an
       attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with Lydia with
       no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in her and her
       family's complete disgrace, but for Darcy's intervention to bribe
       Wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts.
     * Mr William Collins – Mr Collins is Mr Bennet's distant second
       cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate
       of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man, prone to
       making long and tedious speeches, who is excessively devoted to his
       patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
     * Lady Catherine de Bourgh – the overbearing aunt of Mr Darcy. Lady
       Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she resides
       with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr
       Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending,
       and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy, to
       'unite their two great estates', claiming it to be the dearest wish
       of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (née Fitzwilliam).
     * Mr Edward Gardiner and Mrs Gardiner – Edward Gardiner is Mrs
       Bennet's brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and
       gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant and is
       close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are the
       parents of four children. They are instrumental in bringing about
       the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.

     * Georgiana Darcy – Georgiana is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable and shy
       younger sister, with a dowry of £30,000, and is aged barely 16 when
       the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr
       Wickham but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to
       years of tutelage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano,
       singing, playing the harp, drawing, and modern languages and is
       therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an "accomplished
       woman".

     * Charlotte Lucas – Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years
       old (and thus beyond what was then considered prime marriageable
       age), fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore readily
       agrees to marry Mr Collins to gain financial security, having
       seized the opportunity to claim his attentions after Elizabeth
       turns down his proposal. Though the novel stresses the importance
       of love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to
       condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for security. She uses
       Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's
       expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but
       convenience.^[8] Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and
       Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.
     * Colonel Fitzwilliam – Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an
       earl and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne
       Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy
       siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at
       the beginning of the novel. He is the coguardian of Miss Georgiana
       Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr Darcy. According to Colonel
       Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to
       his prospective bride's dowry.

   Diagram showing relationships among the principal characters of Pride
   and Prejudice

Major themes[edit]

   Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of
   Pride and Prejudice but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much
   into the title (which was initially First Impressions), because
   commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. "After the
   success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more
   natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again
   the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

   The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the
   other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and
   prejudice."^[9] The phrase "pride and prejudice" had been used over the
   preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison
   and Samuel Johnson.^[10]^[11] Austen probably took her title from a
   passage in Fanny Burney's Cecilia (1782), a popular novel she is known
   to have admired:

     "The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been
     the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. […] if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you
     owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to
     PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination."^[11]^[12]
     (capitalisation as in the original)

   A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and
   upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.^[13]

   Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world
   and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr and Mrs Bennet as parents is
   blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be
   principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and
   overbearing.^[13] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and
   spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to
   improve greatly in their superior society.^[14]

   The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an
   edition of Austen's novel in 1995:

     Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels
     consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that
     teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room
     making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the
     public punishment of adultery.^[15]

Marriage[edit]

   The opening line of the novel famously announces: "It is a truth
   universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good
   fortune must be in want of a wife."^[16] This sets marriage as a motif
   and a problem in the novel. Readers are poised to question whether or
   not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the
   "neighbourhood" families and their daughters who require a "good
   fortune".

   Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political and
   financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the
   seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial
   circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr and
   Mrs Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial
   attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological).

   The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia,
   re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous.
   Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel
   as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work
   toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees
   them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of
   the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as
   gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a
   better understanding of each other's point of view from the different
   ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.

   When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying
   for love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when
   she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.^[17]
   Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows
   readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially
   when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, companionate
   attraction.^[18]

Wealth[edit]

   Money plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young
   ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman
   of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and
   Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.

   Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a
   higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters
   to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs Bennet is
   frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of
   high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr Bingley arrives, she declares
   "I am thinking of his marrying one of them".^[19]

   Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by
   entailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted
   inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr
   Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr Bennet's death in the
   absence of any closer male heirs, and his proposal to Elizabeth would
   have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer.

   Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have
   independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For
   the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a
   reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and
   the children she was to have.^[20] The irony of the opening line is
   that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be
   looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.^[21]

Class[edit]

   [220px-LadyCatherine_%26_Elisabeth.jpg] Lady Catherine and Elizabeth by
   C. E. Brock,
   1895[220px-Pickering_-_Greatbatch_-_Jane_Austen_-_Pride_and_Prejudice_-
   _This_is_not_to_be_borne%2C_Miss_Bennet.jpg] Lady Catherine confronts
   Elizabeth about Darcy, on the title page of the first illustrated
   edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.

   Austen might be known now for her "romances" but the marriages in her
   novels engage with economics and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice
   is hardly the exception.

   When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social
   differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome,
   though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within
   his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these
   differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what
   Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, "Will the shades of
   Pemberley be thus polluted?" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady
   Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating
   economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as
   gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are "equals"), Lady Catherine
   refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth.
   However, as the novel closes, "…through curiosity to see how his wife
   conducted herself", Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at
   Pemberley.^[22]

   The Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though
   Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst behave and speak of others as if they
   have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it
   clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley
   rents Netherfield Hall – it is, after all, "to let" – distinguishes him
   significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family
   and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an earl.
   Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property but has portable and
   growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for
   poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious
   merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the
   characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the
   plot unfolds.^[23]

   An undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at in the
   story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt,
   Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Fitzwilliam, D'Arcy, de Bourgh (Burke), and
   even Bennet, are traditional Norman surnames.^[24]

Self-knowledge[edit]

   Through their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and
   Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them.
   Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:

     "How despicably have I acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself
     on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who
     have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and
     gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How
     humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I
     been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But
     vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of
     one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning
     of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and
     driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I
     never knew myself."^[25]

   Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least
   are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.

   Tanner writes that Mrs Bennet in particular, "has a very limited view
   of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective
   tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and
   is only aware of material objects".^[26] Mrs Bennet's behaviour
   reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her
   daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. "The business of
   her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and
   news."^[27] This shows that Mrs Bennet is only aware of "material
   objects" and not of her feelings and emotions.^[28]

   A notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet's close friend
   and confidant. She accepts Mr Collins's proposal of marriage once
   Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her
   circumstances as "one of a large family". Charlotte's decision is
   reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.

Style[edit]

   Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative
   technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as "the free
   representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words
   actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the
   character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if
   she thought or spoke".^[29]

   Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and
   unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also
   considerably different.^[30] By using narrative that adopts the tone
   and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth),
   Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint,
   sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. "The learning curve, while
   undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through
   Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ...
   for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within
   Elizabeth's misprisions."^[29]

   The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of
   another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this
   novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as
   through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge
   of Wickham's true character.

   Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from
   viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the
   "oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and
   work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic
   distance."^[5] Beginning with a historical investigation of the
   development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into
   empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool
   that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical
   distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a
   distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a
   scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a
   mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own
   original form.^[31]

Development of the novel[edit]

   [lossy-page1-260px-Letter_from_Jane_Austen_to_her_sister_Cassandra%2C_1
   799_June_11._Page_2_%28NLA%29.tiff.jpg] Page 2 of a letter from Jane
   Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first
   mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First
   Impressions. (NLA)

   Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in
   Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.^[32] It was
   originally titled First Impressions, and was written between October
   1796 and August 1797.^[33] On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a
   letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest
   in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return
   post.^[34]

   The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on
   Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks
   for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge
   camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several
   times.^[35]^: 57  The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment
   leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August
   1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were
   completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and
   1795.^[35]^: 56–57 

   Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First
   Impressions between 1811 and 1812.^[33] As nothing remains of the
   original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced
   to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it
   is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.^[36]

   She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when
   she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for
   £110^[37] (equivalent to £7,800 in 2021). In renaming the novel, Austen
   probably had in mind the "sufferings and oppositions" summarised in the
   final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called "Pride and Prejudice",
   where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.^[13]

   It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid
   confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of
   First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other
   works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford
   and a comedy by Horace Smith.^[34]

Publication history[edit]

   [220px-Brock_Pride_and_Prejudice.jpg] Title page of a 1907 edition
   illustrated by C. E. Brock

   Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the
   Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked for
   £150).^[38] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense
   and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the
   publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and
   the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would
   sell out its edition, making her £140,^[34] she passed the copyright to
   Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the
   profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton
   subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the
   book.^[39]

   Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three
   hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.^[40] It was advertised in The
   Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.^[33] Favourable reviews saw this
   edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year.
   A third edition was published in 1817.^[38]

   Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French;
   subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and
   Swedish.^[41] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United
   States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.^[38]
   The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series
   in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice,
   first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many
   modern published versions of the novel are based.^[38]

   The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's
   novels. However, whereas her first published novel, Sense and
   Sensibility was presented as being written "by a Lady," Pride and
   Prejudice was attributed to "the Author of Sense and Sensibility". This
   began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit
   anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the
   anonymous author of all her then-published works.

Reception[edit]

   Main article: Reception history of Jane Austen

At first publication[edit]

   The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first
   months following publication.^[39] Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be
   the wife of Lord Byron, called it "the fashionable novel".^[39] Noted
   critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he "would rather
   have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the
   Waverley Novels".^[42]

   Charlotte Brontë, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and
   Prejudice was a disappointment, "a carefully fenced, highly cultivated
   garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open
   country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck".^[42]^[43]

   Austen for her part thought the "playfulness and epigrammaticism" of
   Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her
   sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked "shade" and should have
   had a chapter "of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected
   with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the
   history of Buonaparté".^[44]

   Walter Scott wrote in his journal, "Read again and for the third time
   at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and
   Prejudice."^[45]

20th century[edit]

   You could not shock her more than she shocks me,
   Beside her Joyce seems innocent as grass.
   It makes me most uncomfortable to see
   An English spinster of the middle class
   Describe the amorous effects of 'brass',
   Reveal so frankly and with such sobriety
   The economic basis of society.

     W. H. Auden (1937) on Austen^[42]

   The American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the
   criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.^[46] One
   critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the "romantic conclusion" of Pride and
   Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the
   "individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and
   the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic
   society".^[46] Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power structure
   capable of reformation was not an "escape" from conflict.^[46] Johnson
   wrote the "outrageous unconventionality" of Elizabeth Bennet was in
   Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship
   that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the
   1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.^[46]

21st century[edit]

     * In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the "UK's Best-Loved Book" in
       which Pride and Prejudice came second, behind The Lord of the
       Rings.^[47]
     * In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and
       Prejudice came first in a list of the 101 best books ever
       written.^[48]
     * The 200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice on 28 January 2013 was
       celebrated around the globe by media networks such as the
       Huffington Post, The New York Times, and The Daily Telegraph, among
       others.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

Adaptations[edit]

Film, television and theatre[edit]

   See also: Jane Austen in popular culture – Pride and Prejudice

   Numerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularising Pride and
   Prejudice.^[56]

   The first television adaptation of the novel, written by Michael Barry,
   was produced in 1938 by the BBC. It is a lost television
   broadcast.^[56] Some of the notable film versions include the 1940
   Academy Award-winning film, starring Greer Garson and Laurence
   Olivier^[57] (based in part on Helen Jerome's 1935 stage adaptation)
   and that of 2005, starring Keira Knightley (an Oscar-nominated
   performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.^[58] Notable television versions
   include two by the BBC: a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and
   David Rintoul and the popular 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle and
   Colin Firth.

   A stage version created by Helen Jerome premiered at the Music Box
   Theatre in New York in 1935, starring Adrianne Allen and Colin
   Keith-Johnston, and opened at the St James's Theatre in London in 1936,
   starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. First Impressions was a 1959
   Broadway musical version starring Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and
   Hermione Gingold.^[59] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by
   Bernard J. Taylor, with Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet
   and Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy.^[60] A new stage production,
   Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in
   concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell
   as Darcy.^[61] The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera
   Stolthet och fördom on Pride and Prejudice.^[62] Works inspired by the
   book include Bride and Prejudice and Trishna (1985 Hindi TV series).

   The Lizzie Bennet Diaries – which premiered on a dedicated YouTube
   channel on 9 April 2012,^[63] and concluded on 28 March 2013^[64] – is
   an Emmy award-winning web-series^[65] which recounts the story via
   vlogs recorded primarily by the Bennet sisters.^[66]^[67] It was
   created by Hank Green and Bernie Su.^[68]

   In 2018, part of the storyline of the Brazilian soap opera "Orgulho e
   Paixão", aired on TV Globo, was inspired by the book. The soap opera
   was also inspired by other works of Jane Austen. It features actors,
   Nathalia Dill, Thiago Lacerda, Agatha Moreira, Rodrigo Simas, Gabriela
   Duarte, Marcelo Faria [pt], Alessandra Negrini, and Natália do
   Vale.^[69]

   Fire Island is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines
   Pride and Prejudice as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay
   vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie "as an
   unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen's Pride and
   Prejudice."^[70] The movie was released in June 2022 and features a
   main cast of Asian-American actors.

   Bingley, a young doctor and reluctant reality TV celebrity, and his
   medical school classmate, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a cynical

   Pride and Prejudice has also inspired works of scientific writing. In
   2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine
   darcin,^[86] after Mr Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In
   2016, a scientific paper published in the Journal of Inherited
   Metabolic Disease speculated that Mrs Bennet may have been a carrier of
   a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't have any
   sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are so silly.^[87]

   In summer 2014, Udon Entertainment's Manga Classics line published a
   manga adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.^[88]

   them and thinking we deserve what we have."

   -Joyce Meyer.

Historical Context of Pride and Prejudice

The Georgian Era

   Between 1797, when a young Jane Austen began work on what would become
   Pride and Prejudice, and 1813, when the novel was published, the French
   Revolution was fought, Marie Antoinette was guillotined and Napoleon
   rose to power and conquered most of Western Europe. Closer to Austen’s
   home, Great Britain combined with Ireland to become the United Kingdom,
   the slave trade was abolished by Parliament throughout the British
   empire and King George III, driven to apparent madness by what
   historians now suspect to have been a rare hereditary metabolic
   disorder, was replaced in his duties by his son, the Prince Regent,
   later to become King George IV.

   The Georgian era into which Jane Austen was born, characterized for
   Britain by almost constant warfare abroad, was in many ways a
   transitional period. It saw the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the
   shift from Enlightenment to Romantic trends in arts and letters, and
   the first whispers of feminist and abolitionist concerns in Western
   Europe. A little familiarity with these sweeping historical trends can
   lend some context to Austen’s domestic fictions, but perhaps more
   helpful is an understanding of the particular details of daily life
   during the Regency period; life as faced by Austen and so many of her
   fictional characters.

10,000 a Year

   From the 16th well into the 19th century, respectable wealth in England
   was accumulated primarily through the ownership of land. The land would
   be leased to tenants for farming, and the landowning families would
   live entirely off of the income generated by these leases. The families
   owning the largest of these hereditary estates, which varied in size
   but averaged about 10,000 acres, drew incomes sufficient to construct
   great parks and manors, purchase fashionable goods, retain servants and
   livery (horses and carriages), and meet other expenses related to
   keeping a country home. The most prosperous landowners also kept a town
   home in London, the social and political center of England, and lived
   there during the social season, January through July. The oldest,
   though not necessarily the wealthiest, of these families may have had
   some claim to nobility with inherited titles that gave “precedence,” or
   a higher rank at social functions in town or country. The term
   “aristocracy” referred somewhat more ambiguously to any keepers of
   London town homes whose social and political connections bought them
   seats in Parliament or influence in the royal court.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the Bennets are, like Jane Austen herself,
   members of an educated upper middle class known as the “gentry” or the
   “landed gentry.” Considered socially eligible to mix with the
   landowning aristocracy, but quite a step beneath them in wealth,
   resources and precedence, the landed gentry included country squires,
   military officers and many forms of clergy; all acceptable roles for
   the educated younger sons of the aristocracy and their descendants.
   Gentry may have owned less than 1,000 acres of land, may have leased to
   tenants or overseen the farming directly and typically lived in the
   country year-round, visiting London only to take care of occasional
   legal matters.

   Beneath the gentry were the laboring classes of household servants,
   tenant farmers, merchants and “tradesmen,” such as smiths and
   carpenters, village doctors, town lawyers and other professionals.
   Though lower in social standing because their income bore “the taint of
   trade”, many merchants and tradesmen might in fact amass considerable
   wealth and could wind up wealthier than the poorest of the landowners.
   This was especially true as the Industrial Revolution progressed,
   pouring more and more wealth into the trade and merchant classes.

   For the landowners and the gentry, management of all financial matters
   was a gentleman’s prerogative. By law and by custom, a woman was
   granted very little control over money, even money that we would today
   consider her own. A woman of the upper classes could expect to be
   granted a “fortune” from her family upon marriage or the death of her
   father. This lump sum of money would draw interest at a fixed 5 percent
   from investment in government funds, which would contribute to her
   husband’s income if she were married or would cover her living expenses
   if she remained single.

   A man’s income, by contrast, was always reported as a number of pounds
   (£) “per year,” such as Mr. Bingley’s “four or five thousand a year.”
   About £100 a year was the barest minimum income on which a small
   household could be kept, retaining only one maid—a servant being
   necessary to maintain any claim of respectability. On £300 a year, a
   small family could retain two servants and live somewhat more
   comfortably, but still could not afford a carriage, which could only be
   supported on an income of at least £700 a year. Mr. Bennet draws about
   £2,000 a year, which would be sufficient to keep the appearance of
   comfort and respectability; but he bears the financial burden of
   providing dowries for five daughters. However, his estate is “entailed”
   upon his death away from the family to be given to a distant branch of
   the family in lieu of a male Bennet heir. But an income of more than
   £4,000 a year, like Bingley’s, could well-provide for both country and
   town homes, with all of the modern comforts and latest fashions.
   Indeed, Mr. Darcy’s £10,000 a year has been calculated in recent
   decades to be worth between $300,000 and $800,000 in U.S. dollars;
   while another estimate, comparing Mr. Darcy’s income against the
   Regency average, gives him the real purchasing power of a modern
   multimillionaire.

An Accomplished Lady

   Some aspects of Regency life that have a strong bearing on the action
   in Austen’s novels are not necessarily given detailed description,
   because Austen’s first readers would already have been intimately
   acquainted with the highly formalized manners of the time. The custom
   of paying visits and leaving calling cards, for example, could consume
   the greater portion of a woman’s day, and many breaches of etiquette
   could spring from unreturned or improperly returned calls.

   In addition to beauty, mastery of etiquette, a sharp mind or a pleasant
   disposition, a lady could show her gentility through the display of her
   “accomplishments.” Accomplishments were sets of skills encouraged and
   cultivated in young women, skills which were thought to help make a
   home more lively, entertaining or beautiful. Common accomplishments
   included drawing, needlework, playing an instrument or singing well,
   and mastering languages. A woman with many of these skills was thought
   to be “highly accomplished,” and, evidently, more marriageable.

   Marriage, of course, was just about the only acceptable role for any
   woman. Women, like Austen herself, who passed beyond their youth
   without marrying became spinsters. They had no formal role in society
   and were occasionally a burden to their families. Even worse was the
   fate of educated young women of good standing whose fortunes were
   thrown in jeopardy by the sudden loss of their family. With no fortune,
   these women were nearly unmarriageable and might be required to enter
   the servant class as a governess of wealthy children in order to
   provide a living for themselves.

     * Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often

Pride Edinburgh is the longest running free celebration of the LGBT community
in Scotland.

   Since starting in 1994, Pride Edinburgh has grown exponentially.
   Coupled with the growth of digital channels we see our own digital
   presence as a vital part to engage with the community.

   Based on our community’s feedback and our ambitions we see the
   following as key areas of focus in the coming years:
     * Developing Pride Edinburgh’s value in the community by becoming a
       directory and promoter of LGBT life in Edinburgh and beyond.
     * Continue to grow the event to continuously improve accessibility
       and impact for the LGBT community.

7 Deadly Sins: Pride

Contributed by Stephen Funderburk on Feb 26, 2008

        | 5,725 views
       The first of the seven deadly sins, considered the root of all
       others sins. It was this sin that caused Lucifer to fall from
       heaven.
       The first of the seven deadly sins is pride. A simple definition of
       the word pride is an exaggerated opinion of one’s value and worth.
       It is the attitude of superiority over others. A biblical example
       of pride is the tower of Babel where the people said, we will make
       a name for ourselves. Tonight ...read more

Breaking The Power Of Pride

        | 2,196 views
       Believers may not often realize it, we are either centered on man
       or centered on God. There is no alternative. Either God is the
       center and we have become rightly adjusted to him, or we are the
       center and everything revolves around us. How is power of pride
       broken?

Those Feelings Of Pride Series

Contributed by David Owens on Apr 11, 2021
        | 4,047 views
       God has given us the ability to feel the emotion of pride so that
       we can benefit from good pride and avoid the destructive nature of
       bad pride. It is important to know the difference between the two
       kinds of pride.
       A. Once there was a guy named Zeke who had so much pride he could
       never admit he was wrong. 1. One day Zeke wandered into the
       blacksmith shop with sawdust all over the floor. 2. A few minutes
       before Zeke arrived, the blacksmith had been working on an

   Three young femmes in ornate dresses sit on top of a vehicle decorated
   with plastic leaves. On the rightmost side, a person with full make up,
   red lips, and big circle ear rings looks at the camera, with their lips
   open as if speaking. Their costume is inspired by water, with a blue
   neckpiece with stones in it looking like waves. Their bra also looks
   like waves and has pearls hanging off it. Behind them is an umbrella
   with lime green horizontal stripes. The person in the middle wears a
   traditional looking costume with many brown and orange beads, holding
   up a fake bow and arrow. They are looking to the side, also seeming to
   chant. Their headdress consits of a colorful headband over their
   forehead and brown beads framing their face. Behind them is a
   rainbow-colored umbrella. The person to the right is wearing a pink
   dress, largely hidden by their left forearm and the middle person's bow
   and arms. They are shouting to the crowd, while holding a bright pink
   decorative ornament with light pink roses around it. Behind them, a
   rainbow flag waves.

Ambassador Gutmann's Opening Statement for Pride Day Panel 2023

   AMB Gutmann delivering remarks in chancery courtyard Today we have
   invited you all to join us in honoring the contributions of the LGBTQ+
   communities in both Germany and the United States, to celebrate their
   legacy, and to chart an inspiring course — “toward a more perfect
   union” — for the future.  That is what Pride Month is all about –
   taking stock of the past to prepare us for a more inclusive, just, and
   joyful future.

   Speaking of more inclusive, just, and joyful: This year, President
   Biden hosted the largest Pride celebration in White House history with
   LGBTQ+ families from across the country.

   And here at the Embassy and at our five Consulates, the past 12 months
   have been Pride Year.

   Last summer, we rolled out a series of Pride events to promote LGBTQIA+
   rights. We followed up throughout the year with multiple programs
   highlighting what together we are doing in the United States and
   Germany to advance equality for the LGBTQIA+ community both at home and
   abroad.  You have been our partners in these programs, and many more.
   For that, and much more: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

   On his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic Executive
   Order charging the federal government with protecting LGBTQIA+ people
   from discrimination —on everything ranging from health care to housing,
   education to employment, commerce and criminal justice.

   Our country—and every country—is stronger when our leaders reflect our
   full diversity, and when our rights and values are woven into the daily
   work of our government. Toward a more perfect union starts at the White
   House, our Embassy, and all our embassies around the world.

   We have made real progress but we cannot rest content. There is an
   urgency of this moment.  There are those who want to roll back the
   progress so many have fought so hard to achieve.  In the United States,
   we are seeing many very threatening attacks to our most basic values
   and freedoms — from book bans to anti-LGBTQ+ laws to harassment of
   individuals.

   In a third of the world’s countries, queer status or conduct is
   illegal.  In some places, same-sex relationships are criminalized –
   even punishable by death—and people often have no choice but to seek
   refuge elsewhere.  Even in countries of asylum, stigma and abuse are
   far too common.

   Let us be crystal clear: Queer rights are human rights!

   All of our work to promote human rights has real effects. People are
   looking to us. Toward a more perfect union.

   Because both Germany and the United States have played meaningful roles
   in the fight for queer rights, we feel a special and joyful duty to
   celebrate Pride. We will avidly advocate for LGBTQI+ rights as often as
   possible right here at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.

   Let us celebrate the transatlantic struggle for queer rights. Germany
   named its pride celebrations after a street in New York City.
   Christopher Street was the site of a despicable police raid and the
   courage to resist that oppression – and persist. Stonewall was a
   milestone in the American civil rights movement and it launched a
   global movement.

   Let us also recognize the pioneering work of Magnus Hirschfeld at the
   Institute for Sexual Science, established here in Berlin in 1919.
   Magnus’s trailblazing research was lost to the brutality of the Nazi
   regime, but the spark of his idea that queer people deserved rights and
   support could not be extinguished.

   Both these moments in history—one American, one German—show why “toward
   a more perfect union” can never be taken for granted.  This coming
   Saturday, we will be riding and marching – proudly– alongside our
   partners from the Auswärtiges Amt and other Embassies. We are marching
   across Germany – in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Rostock, Leipzig, Muenster, and
   Munich.

   We will never kid ourselves: defending hard-won rights in the face of
   ongoing discrimination is serious work.

   This evening, we could not be prouder than to continue our tradition of
   Pride programs in welcoming Germany’s anti-discrimination commissioner,
   Ferda Ataman.

   We know that history doesn’t just travel forward.  Advancing the gains
   our countries have made requires continual hard work, what I call
   “eternal vigilance.”

   In conclusion, let me say that we will stand proudly for the human
   rights of all people, everywhere. Let me propose a heartfelt toast: To
   a more LGBTQ plus perfect world!

     Amazing night celebrating #PrideMonth at the @usbotschaft with
     LGBTQIA+ friends. Let us be crystal clear: Queer rights are human
     rights! pic.twitter.com/mpiovdARd7

   FAQs
   My name in the visa does not show a transliterated German "Umlaut". Do
   I need to have the visa corrected?
   No. Umlaute” in German names are not transliterated. The letter “ä”
   will be shown as “a”, not “ae”, the letter “ö” as “o” etc.
   I have a visa - Can I travel?
   Information on visa validity and what the visa expiration date means is
   available at
   http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/visa-expiration-d
   ate.html.
   How do I determine which visa category I should apply for? Can the U.S.
   Consular Section tell me which visa I should apply for?
   Information on visa categories is provided on our visa directory page.
   Visa processing begins when the application is received on the
   appointment day. We are unable to make any related decisions before an
   application is received. We are also not authorized to speculate about
   the result of a visa application an applicant is preparing.
   Performers, Entertainers and Athletes
   Information on O- and P visas for performers, entertainers and athletes
   is available on our visa directory page. If you are not sure whether
   you need an O or P visa, send us a short description of the planned
   activities.
   I was told that my visa application needs additional administrative
   processing. What does that mean and how long will it take?
   Under current U.S. law and regulations certain applicants require
   additional administrative processing before a visa can be issued. The
   amount of time required to carry out this additional administrative
   processing varies. It can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to
   several months or longer. We are unable to expedite this process.
   My child has a “Kinderreisepass” and needs a visa urgently, can you
   help me?
   While we can process urgent visa applications, we encourage all
   travelers, children and babies included, to obtain an E-passport. An
   expedited E-passport can be obtained more quickly (within 72 hours) and
   at less cost than a U.S. visa. Please contact your local passport
   office immediately about this option. Should you choose to apply for a
   visa for your child, you can drop off or mail in his or her application
   and all the required documents if the child is under 14 years of age.
   If the child is 14 or older, an appointment and a personal appearance
   are necessary. However, you should be aware of the fact that it takes
   2-3 days for the visa application to be processed and the visa to be
   issued, and then it will be mailed to you via the German postal system.
   We cannot guarantee any specific date when the visa will be ready.

   Hempstead, NY - Hofstra University Head Women's Tennis Coach Tripp Tuff
   announced today three outstanding student-athletes who will serve as
   captains for the Pride during their 2024 season.
   Earning this incredible leadership role are: Kaitlyn Ferguson, Deniz
   Soyer, and Lea Forste-Dinell.
   "These three young women represent the change we are implementing
   within the Hofstra women's tennis program," commented Tuff. "They are
   dedicated to the process and possess a team above self mentality, which
   are qualities I know will help take this program in a positive
   direction on and off the court."
   Ferguson, a junior from Lantana, Texas, led the team in singles
   victories during her first year with the Pride. She has been named to
   Hofstra's Dean's List, the CAA Commissioner's Academic Honor Roll, and
   an ITA Scholar-Athlete each of her last two years at Hofstra.
   A junior from Basildon, England, Soyer has compiled a career 11-32
   record in singles play and a 16-29 record in doubles. Soyer has been
   named to the Hofstra Athletic Director Scholars, and CAA Commissioner's
   Academic Honor Rolls each year, and has earned recognition as an ITA
   Scholar Athlete.
   Forste-Dinell, a junior from Stockholm, Sweden, joined the Pride this
   year after two seasons at the University of Illinois Chicago. There
   Forste-Dinell complied a career 20-18 record in singles and a career
   5-14 record in doubles play. She was named a 2023 ITA Scholar-Athlete
   while in Chicago.

Parades but no public posts: which brands are supporting Pride in the wake of
backlash?

   As Target, Bud Light, Starbucks and others face threats and boycotts,
   here’s what other top US brands have planned

   In recent years, Pride month has served as an opportunity for global
   brands to demonstrate their inclusivity – marching in parades, touting
   support for LGBTQ+ causes and blanketing merchandise in rainbow flags.

   In the past, that’s led to concerns over “rainbow-washing”:
   corporations shrewdly supporting LGBTQ+ communities in more liberal
   territories for marketing purposes, without expending political or
   financial capital to stand by persecuted queer people around the world.

   But the political environment in the US is shifting. Republican state
   legislatures are passing laws restricting LGBTQ+ rights and
   conservative media personalities are demonizing trans people. Some
   companies have faced a rightwing backlash over recent Pride promotions.
   After a promotional campaign with Dylan Mulvaney, a trans influencer,
   sparked a boycott of Bud Light, its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, put
   executives on leave and distanced itself from its own campaign. And
   last month, Target pulled some Pride-themed products off its shelves,
   saying customers had been threatening employees.

   Will pressure from the right cause prominent US companies to back down,
   despite track records of support for Pride? Some brands have maintained
   a strong commitment to visibly supporting the cause, but others are
   celebrating more quietly than last year – for instance, sponsoring
   parades but ignoring Pride on their social media accounts. Here’s what
   we know about their plans for 2023.

Adidas

   The company has already taken heat from the right this year over its
   choice of model for a traditionally feminine swimsuit. The swimsuit is
   included in the company’s 2023 Pride collection, in conjunction with
   the queer South African designer Rich Mnisi. Despite some furious
   anti-trans statements and calls for a boycott, the company has
   continued to promote the swimwear and, in a statement to USA Today,
   defended “a diverse line of models who bring the spirit of this
   collection to life”.

Amazon

   The e-commerce site has participated in parades and concerts for Pride
   month. Last year, however, the Pride parade in its home town of Seattle
   cut ties over Amazon’s donations to politicians who have backed
   anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, according to Seattle Pride. The organization
   also opposed what it described as Amazon’s offer of $100,000 to get the
   parade named after itself. In response to a Guardian inquiry, the
   company said it had “nothing to share” on its plans for this year,
   though it is listed as a parade sponsor. Last year it posted Pride
   content on Instagram throughout the month of June. This year, as of 7
   June, the company has no posts about Pride on its grid (although
   smaller accounts like Amazon Music have been posting Pride content).

Anheuser-Busch

   The owner of Bud Light faced strong conservative backlash over its work
   with Mulvaney: sales fell 23% in the four weeks leading to mid-May. The
   company has backed away from the promotion, blaming it on an outside
   agency, and a pair of executives were put on leave in late April. In
   past years, Anheuser-Busch has touted its support for LGBTQ+
   communities, partnering with LGBTQ+-owned businesses and promoting a
   rainbow-colored bottle. This year the company has yet to mention Pride
   on either the Budweiser or Bud Light Twitter accounts or Instagram
   grids. The company did not respond to a Guardian request for comment on
   its plans for Pride month, but it does appear to be quietly sponsoring
   some parades this year. It has also donated $200,000 to the National
   LGBT Chamber of Commerce amid criticism over its response to the
   boycott.

Apple

   The tech company, which has had a robust presence at its local San
   Francisco Pride parade, also works with a number of LGBTQ+
   organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Center
   for Transgender Equality and the Trevor Project. For 2023, it is
   promoting a Pride-themed band for the Apple Watch, continuing a
   tradition of using Pride colors on the device that began in 2016 and
   was expanded with additional colors in 2021 to represent Black, Latino,
   trans and non-binary people.

Bank of America

   The bank’s website has a detailed accounting of its support for LGBTQ+
   rights, and it has sponsored several major Pride parades in the past.
   It continues with parade sponsorships this year and celebrated 1 June
   on Instagram.

Burger King

   In 2021, the fast-food chain trolled Chick-fil-A, which has donated to
   organizations seen as anti-LGBTQ+, by promoting its plan to donate to
   the LGBTQ+ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign for each chicken
   sandwich it sold. Last year, it faced anger from LGBTQ+ communities for
   ham-handed advertisements in Austria featuring Whoppers with “two equal
   buns” – either two top buns or two bottom buns on the same burger. This
   year, its plans are unclear; the company did not immediately respond to
   a request for comment.

Chick-fil-A

   In a remarkable turn of events, the company that has long faced
   accusations of homophobia is now facing boycott threats for being too
   progressive. That’s because, on its website, it champions diversity,
   equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and has hired a DEI chief.
   “Chick-fil-A has gone woke,” tweeted the rightwinger Ian Miles Cheong.
   But neither the initiatives nor the position are new, as the New York
   Times pointed out. The company developed a conservative reputation over
   its donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian
   Athletes, which have voiced anti-gay views. In 2012, the company’s then
   CEO, Dan Cathy, expressed opposition to marriage equality.

Coca-Cola

   The beverage company has sponsored major Pride parades and it continues
   to sell Pride-themed merchandise. It did not respond to a Guardian
   request for comment on its plans for this year, but it is listed as a
   sponsor of several parades.

Dick’s Sporting Goods

   The Pennsylvania-based retailer appears to have big plans for Pride
   2023, with a list of parades on its site. It’s also promoting a broad
   collection of Pride items.

Disney

   The company has been embroiled since last year in a feud with Florida’s
   governor, Ron DeSantis, over the state’s “don’t say gay” law, which
   bars teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity from
   kindergarten to third grade. The company is also involved in a legal
   battle over control of its self-governing district, which the state
   sought to take over last year following Disney’s opposition to the
   “don’t say gay” measure. This year, it has a new Pride apparel
   collection and is planning two “Disneyland After Dark” Pride nights for
   the first time in June.

Google

   The tech company has held “virtual Pride parades”, which use
   smartphones and headsets to allow anyone to join a parade from wherever
   they are. It has also participated in and sponsored real-life ones,
   including this year. On 1 June, the main search site marked Pride with
   an article describing how the company is celebrating Pride, including
   highlighting certain apps and LGBTQ+ creators on YouTube.

JPMorgan Chase

   The bank describes itself as a longstanding supporter of the community,
   providing large donations to pro-LGBTQ+ causes, sponsoring Pride
   parades and working with advocacy groups. Last year, however, Pride
   Northwest, which is behind the Portland event, cut ties to the bank
   over its financial support for politicians backing anti-LGBTQ+ causes.
   In a statement to the Guardian, the company highlighted its recently
   created office of LGBTQ+ affairs, “focused on driving equity and
   inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees, customers, clients and communities 365
   days a year”.

Kohl’s

   The department store is promoting Pride-themed clothing collections –
   and now faces a boycott akin to the backlash against Target, with
   opponents tweeting their fury about “Pride merch for babies”. Kohl’s
   did not reply to a request for comment, but as of Wednesday the items
   appeared to remain available, and on 1 June the company marked Pride
   month on its site and social media. Last year, Kohl’s was a “gold”
   level sponsor of the Pride parade in Milwaukee, where it is based, for
   the first time. It remains a gold sponsor this year.

Levi Strauss &amp; Co

   The San Francisco-based clothing company, which has participated in the
   city’s parade, has launched a Pride campaign and apparel line for this
   year. Asked whether rightwing pressure on other companies would affect
   the outfitter, a spokesperson said Levi’s was “continuing with its
   Pride collection and marketing as planned”.

Los Angeles Dodgers

   The baseball team has already made a few swings and misses this year.
   Initially it planned to honor the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a
   group of queer “nuns” that hold street drag shows and support
   charitable causes, at a game on 16 June. But when the Florida
   Republican senator Marco Rubio accused the group of being
   anti-Christian, the team rescinded its invitation – only to re-invite
   them amid anger from LGBTQ+ rights groups. The team apologized for the
   disinvitation. On 1 June, it marked Pride month on Instagram.

Mars

   Company brands including M&amp;Ms and Skittles have prominently supported
   LGBTQ+ rights in the past, including “lesbian” M&amp;Ms celebrating
   marriage equality and colorless Skittles packaging with the slogan
   “only one rainbow matters”. This year, Skittles has new packaging
   designed by LGBTQ+ artists, with some proceeds going to the LGBTQ+
   advocacy group Glaad, as they have in past years.

Maybelline

   The makeup company is also dealing with calls for a boycott for working
   with Mulvaney, after she posted a video of herself using its products.
   The website of its parent company, L’Oréal, lists Pride plans and
   affiliations involving a number of its brands, including parade
   participation and partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations. Maybelline
   itself featured drag performers on its Instagram to celebrate 1 June.

McDonald’s

   The fast-food chain has participated in various LGBTQ+-themed
   promotions, including fries with a rainbow box. This year, it will
   sponsor several Pride parades, including in Los Angeles and Dallas.

Miller Lite

   The Bud Light rival has a long history of support for LGBTQ+ causes and
   appears to be continuing with it this year. It touts “town halls” in
   various cities where bars serving the beer can work toward inclusivity
   and sponsors events including the Dallas Pride Miller Lite music
   festival. In a statement to the Guardian, Miller’s parent company,
   Molson Coors, said: “Everyone deserves to feel comfortable having a
   drink and being themselves. That’s why beer, wine and spirits companies
   like ours have supported Pride for decades, why we’ll do so in 2023 and
   why we’ll continue to do so for decades to come.”

NHL

   Hockey teams have attempted to hold a number of Pride nights this year,
   only to see many players refuse to don Pride-themed jerseys. (In some
   cases, they may have had legal concerns given Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+
   laws; 5% of the league’s players are Russian.) Last year, the league
   promoted Pride month celebrations; its plans for this year are unclear.
   As of 7 June, it had not tweeted about Pride; last year, it posted to
   celebrate on 1 June.

Nike

   The athletic brand is continuing its Be True collection to mark Pride
   month.

North Face

   Like Adidas, the North Face is dealing with conservative calls for a
   boycott, led by the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. In
   this case, the anger followed an ad campaign featuring the drag queen
   Pattie Gonia for the brand’s Summer of Pride campaign, featuring
   outdoor workshops, as well as its collection of Pride merchandise. The
   company defended the campaign in a statement to Fox News, saying it has
   “always believed the outdoors should be a welcoming, equitable and safe
   place for all. We are honored and grateful to support partners like
   Pattie Gonia who help make this vision a reality.” As of 1 June, it
   also featured its “out in nature” campaign prominently on its website.
   Still, Fox reported that some items for children appeared to have been
   removed from the brand’s site.

PepsiCo

   The beverage company has continued to broadcast its support for Pride
   online this year and is sponsoring the New York City Pride parade.

Starbucks

   The coffee company highlights its work on behalf of LGBTQ+ rights
   extensively on its website, including a timeline of its “history of
   inclusion”. This year, it is sponsoring Pride parades including in Los
   Angeles and San Diego. Meanwhile, it’s facing boycott calls after
   airing an ad in India celebrating a young person’s transition. In a
   statement to the Guardian, the company said it “unequivocally
   support[s] the LGBTQIA2+ community” and would “continue to use our
   voice to advocate for greater understanding on the importance of
   inclusion and diversity across the communities we serve around the
   world”. The company has, however, been accused of failing to live up to
   its own standards when it comes to trans employees.

Target

   The big-box retailer is offering an extensive Pride-themed apparel
   collection, but it has removed some items, citing threats to its
   employees. Experts have warned that the company’s decision could
   “embolden alt-right actors”, encouraging them to believe that threats
   and boycotts are effective. As of 1 June, it was promoting the Pride
   collection prominently on its website.

Donald Trump

   The former president offered an array of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise in
   2019, even as he barred trans troops from serving openly and sought to
   support companies seeking to skirt anti-discrimination laws. Believe it
   or not, this year there is no Pride merch available on his campaign
   site.

Walmart

   Despite threats to its big-box competitor Target, Walmart says it is
   not changing its own Pride collection: “We have merchandise that we
   sell all year that supports different groups.” The company, which also
   promoted Pride month on its site and social media, says it has not
   faced threats of its own.

Wells Fargo

   The bank proclaims its support for LGBTQ+ rights, calling itself an
   early leader in the movement. This year, it will “continue to honor and
   celebrate Pride Month by supporting local LGBTQ+ organizations in
   several cities across the country and hosting employee celebrations”,
   it said in a statement to the Guardian.

Yum! Brands

   Last year, conservatives called for boycotts of Pizza Hut over its
   promotion of a picture book called Big Wig, which tells a story about
   drag performers. Its parent company, Yum! Brands, did not respond to a
   request for comment about its plans for this year. On 1 June, the
   company posted on Twitter to celebrate Pride.

   Every time someone ripped down the rainbow Pride flag from the Mag.Pi
   clothing store in the San Bernardino mountains in California, the
   store’s owner, Laura Ann Carleton, responded by putting up a bigger
   one.

   Ms. Carleton, 66, did not waver in her support of L.G.B.T.Q. people.

   Around 5 p.m. on Friday, she was fatally shot by a man who made
   disparaging remarks about the shop’s Pride flag, the authorities said.

   The man, whom the police on Monday identified as Travis Ikeguchi, 27,
   ran off. Deputies found him with a handgun, and he was killed in an
   encounter with law enforcement, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s
   Department said in a statement.

   The department said that “detectives learned the suspect made several
   disparaging remarks about a rainbow flag that stood outside the store
   before shooting Carleton.”

   It was unclear whether the shooting, which occurred near Lake Arrowhead
   in Cedar Glen, was being investigated as a hate crime, and additional
   details of what preceded the attack were not available on Sunday.

   Sheriff’s Department officials said at a news conference on Monday that
   they were still investigating the motivation of the shooter, who was a
   Cedar Glen resident. He “yelled many homophobic slurs toward Carleton”
   before the attack, the police said, and had posted content on social
   media that was critical of law enforcement and the L.G.B.T.Q.
   community.

   The shooting came about a month after the Anti-Defamation League and
   the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group GLAAD released a report indicating a
   recent rise in anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment, vandalism or assault in the
   United States.

   Ms. Carleton’s daughter Ari Carleton, 28, said that her mother was
   “fearless” and put the needs of others ahead of her own. Ms. Carleton
   had been a pillar in the community, she added.

   When a rare blizzard struck the area this year, Ms. Carleton, whose
   given name was Laura but who went by Lauri, and her husband, Bort
   Carleton, converted her shop into a relief center.

   “She opened up a free shop where she and my dad just gave out supplies
   to those in need who had been impacted by the storms,” Ari Carleton
   said in a phone interview on Sunday, adding, “That really sums up who
   she was as a person.”

   Ms. Carleton preached “love, acceptance and equality,” her daughter
   said, and those values were reflected in her store, Mag.Pi, where she
   carried a collection of personally curated, high-quality and ethically
   sourced clothes, and sometimes her own designs.

   Paul Feig, the film director, was a friend of Ms. Carleton’s. He would
   have dinner with Ms. Carleton and friends on his visits to Lake
   Arrowhead.

   “She was just a force of nature,” Mr. Feig said, adding, “She just
   really cared about people.”

   The Pride flag hanging outside Mag.Pi was removed numerous times by
   different people since the store opened two years ago, Ari Carleton
   said.

   The store is listed as a “business ally” by Lake Arrowhead LGBTQ+, a
   community group.

   “Lauri did not identify as LGBTQ+, but spent her time helping &amp;
   advocating for everyone in the community,” the group said on Facebook.
   “She will be truly missed.”

   The organization is planning a vigil for Ms. Carleton once the threat
   of Tropical Storm Hilary clears.

   She is survived by her husband and nine children.

   “I just want the world to remember her for who she was,” Ari Carleton
   said. “And that she passed away in a place that she cherished, doing
   what she loved and defending something that was so important to her.”

   At Ms. Carleton’s Lake Arrowhead home after the shooting, her family
   opened a package that had been left at the doorstep.

   The flag at the store had begun to fade, Ari Carleton said. Her mother
   had ordered a new one.

   The three artists chosen include Vanille Verloës, a French digital
   fashion designer and artist.

   Her artwork for Givenchy is named 'L’Arbre de Vie' (The Tree of Life),
   and is said to represent an individual's personal growth and
   development.

   SamJ is an American non-binary artist, now based in Amsterdam, and has
   been named among the 100 most influential Web3 personalities by
   industry title NFTnow.

   'Engaged Dynamics', created for Givenchy Beauty, aims to reflect the
   artist’s personal experience of trans identity.

   Art by Edgar Fabian Frias, a non-binary artist based in LA, has been
   viewed than 300 million times on Giphy.

   Their piece named 'Chroma Nexus' is a 30 second GIF, in which abstract
   intensely coloured shapes come to life.

Republican attorneys general issue warning letter to Target about Pride
merchandise

   Target pulls some LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise after backlash 06:18

   Seven U.S. state attorneys general sent a letter to Target on Wednesday
   warning that clothes and merchandise sold as part of the company's
   Pride month campaigns might violate their state's child protection
   laws.

   Republican attorneys general from Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky,
   Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina signed the letter, writing
   that they were "concerned by recent events involving the company's
   'Pride' campaign."

   The attorneys said that they believed the campaign was a "comprehensive
   effort to promote gender and sexual identity among children,"
   criticizing items like T-shirts that advertised popular drag queens and
   a T-shirt that said 'Girls Gays Theys.' They also highlighted
   merchandise with "anti Christian designs such as pentagrams, horned
   skulls and other Satanic products."

   The letter also criticized Target for donating to GLSEN, an LGBTQ+
   organization that works to end bullying in schools based on sexual and
   gender identity. The company stated in a 2020 guide that school staff
   should not tell parents about a child's gender or sexual orientation
   without consulting the child first, something the attorneys general
   said undermines "parents' constitutional and statutory rights."

   The letter did not include any specific demands nor did it outline how
   they believe the campaign could violate child protection laws, but the
   attorneys general did suggest that Target might find it "more
   profitable to sell the type of Pride that enshrines the love of the
   United States."

   The attorneys general also said they believed Target's Pride campaign
   threatened their financial interests, writing that Target leadership
   has a "fiduciary duty to our States as shareholders in the company" and
   suggesting that company officials "may be negligent" in promoting the
   campaign since it has negatively affected Target's stock prices and led
   to some backlash among customers.

   Target shares have declined 12% this year, but the company is facing
   issues far beyond the backlash to its Pride collection, which included
   onesies, bibs, and T-shirts for babies and children. Like many
   retailers, the company is struggling with a pullback in consumer
   spending because of high inflation, which has weighed on its profits.

   But Target is also facing scrutiny for its merchandise selection,
   including its Pride line, with its stores removing some of the items in
   May after facing threats. At the time, the company didn't specify which
   products were being removed, although Target has faced criticism online
   over swimsuits advertised as "tuck-friendly" with "extra crotch
   coverage" in its Pride collection.

   "Target's management has no duty to fill stores with objectionable
   goods, let alone endorse or feature them in attention-grabbing displays
   at the behest of radical activists," the attorneys general wrote.
   "However, Target management does have fiduciary duties to its
   shareholders to prudently manage the company and act loyally in the
   company's best interests."

   Backlash to the Pride campaign did involve threats of violence to
   Target stores and workers. Some merchandise was relocated to less
   popular areas of the store, and other pieces, including the swimsuits
   criticized by the attorneys general, were removed.

   "Since introducing this year's collection, we've experienced threats
   impacting our team members' sense of safety and well-being while at
   work," Target said in a statement earlier in June. "Given these
   volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans,
   including removing items that have been at the center of the most
   significant confrontational behavior."

70 Pride Quotes to Inspire Confidence in Yourself

   Stephanie Kirby
   By Stephanie Kirby | Published May 9, 2022

   Are you lacking a little confidence?

   It might be time to get in touch with your pride.

   These pride quotes will inspire you into action.

   What do you think of when you hear the word “pride”?

   Many people think of “pride” as being something bad, as in “pride goes
   before the fall”.

   And while it’s true that pride can become negative if you are too
   caught up in it, it’s also important.

   With Pride Month now upon us, festivities across the United States will
   create safe spaces while celebrating the lives and journeys of LGBTQ+
   individuals everywhere. In addition to the countless Pride parades and
   festivities, queer creators and their art will also be centered this
   year – many art galleries, museums and other art spaces will be staging
   amazing art exhibitions, movie screenings and more throughout the month
   of June. Here are some of the best art events to catch.

Divine Queerness

   Centering around healing journeys, this exhibition at the Center –
   which celebrates its 40th year supporting LGBTQ+ community in New York
   City – brings together the work of seven artists. It includes the New
   York City downtown artist Lola Flash, originally active in Act Up in
   the 1980s, whose art sits at the intersection of race, sexual identity,
   ageing and social justice activism. Also on view is Mexican artist
   Gabriel García Román, whose vivid multimedia art presents layers of
   queer identity on individual portraits.

   The Minneapolis Institute of Art offers a variety of events to bring
   Pride to museumgoers. Festivities kick off on 2 June with a gathering
   in the park capped off by a screening of Kiki, seen by many critics as
   a sequel of sorts to the landmark documentary Paris Is Burning, updated
   for an era of Black Lives Matter and renewed focus on trans rights.
   Another must-see event is the 22 June Pride Panel and Activations,
   featuring local artists including Kehayr Brown-Ransaw, Trista Marie
   McGovern, Julia Starr, giving them space to share details of the
   intersection of their artistic practices and queer identities.

Pride Not Prejudice

   A group show of 28 LGBTQ+ California artists, Pride Not Prejudice is
   the jewel in the Sausalito Art Center’s Pride festivities. The show is
   headlined by Homosocial, a project by artist Brian Van Camerik in which
   he takes photos of same-gendered couples and displays them in various
   forms, including homemade reliquaries, offering a deep dive into the
   many layers of queer relationships. The show also offers contributions
   from the Bay Area mixed media artist Dianne Hoffman, whose intricate
   boxes showcase repurposed and salvaged objects, and Ajuan Mance, whose
   artist practice draws from cartoons and breaks down stereotypes around
   Black individuals.

Pride: In Retrospect

   Art Museum

   The Newport Art Museum offers audiences a photographic journey through
   decades of the battle for civil rights for queer Americans. The exhibit
   offers special focus on the origins and timeline precipitating the
   Stonewall uprising of 1969 – largely credited with launching the modern
   fight for equality in the LGBTQ+ community – and the first Queer
   Liberation March of 1970, which marked the first anniversary of
   Stonewall and is widely known as the first annual June Pride parade.
   Images on display include activists marching at the 1980 New York Pride
   Parade, a memorial to the Pulse nightclub atrocity, and the historic
   Stonewall Inn.

Rainbow on the Eastside

   Seattle’s third annual Rainbow on the Eastside LGBTQ+ art extravaganza
   will take over Centro Cultural Mexicano’s Mi Casa location and its main
   office throughout the month. It welcomes a diverse group of over a
   dozen new and part artists. Newcomers include the queer Latina
   Anaïsysiria, whose work is typified by vibrant colors and large, bold
   shapes; Ariel Mei, a queer Chinese American artist whose practice
   centers on the beauty of the ocean and is informed by her pursuit of
   scuba diving; and Théo Nguyen, a queer Vietnamese American artist
   working in watercolors, gouache, pencils and the iPad app Procreate.

Take Pride! A Retrospective of LGBTQ+ Life in South Florida

   Fort Lauderdale’s Take Pride! offers a photographic exhibit during
   Pride month chronicling the struggle for equal rights in south Florida,
   as well as the development of the thriving LGBTQ+ community in the
   area, covering the 1940s through the present. On view of Galleria Fort
   Lauderdale, the show of photographs, video, archival costumes and more
   brings together pieces from the Stonewall Museum, the World Aids
   Museum, Key West Art &amp; Historical Society and others. It includes a
   screening of the award-winning short film Open Dialogues, an oral
   history documenting voices from the LGBTQ+ community.

Pride at Whitney

   New York’s Whitney Museum offers multiple special events centering
   queer art and culture. On 5 June it honors the release of the HBO
   documentary The Stroll – chronicling the lives of the trans women of
   color who helped shape the city’s Meatpacking District – with an
   after-hours party following the screening of the movie at Gansevoort
   Plaza. On 9 June, the museum opens its doors to queer teens for a
   special evening of festivities, while on 17 June the Whitney welcomes
   The Piers Project for a special night of queer dance. And throughout
   the month, walking tours led from the Whitney will explore the queer
   history of the neighborhood around the museum.

WeHo Pride Arts Festival

   West Hollywood’s signature Pride celebration offers a month-long arts
   festival with exhibitions, marketplaces, performances and more. The
   digital art Angelic Troublemakers Exhibition runs all month at the West
   Hollywood library, while the Indigenous Korean American transgender
   artist Coyote Park shows their work at the One Gallery. Literary series
   WeHo Reads offers a night of literature on 14 June, featuring the
   writers Kamden Hilliard, K-Ming Chang, Golden and Natalie Wee, while 17
   June offers the LGBTQ+ craft market Beautiful Things at Plummer Park
   Community Center.

   The month is capped by a queer book bazaar on 24 June, with numerous
   vendors and performances.

The meaning of Pride

   Fifty-four years ago, something important happened that changed the way
   people think about LGBTQIA+ rights. It started at the Stonewall Inn in
   New York City. The police used to arrest LGBTQIA+ people there just for
   being themselves. One day, the community fought back. They had enough
   of the discrimination and unfair treatment.

   These protests, known as the Stonewall Riots, lasted for several days.
   People like Marsha P. Johnson stood up against the arrests and fought
   for equality. Johnson became a leader and worked hard to bring
   attention to the issues faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. In the many
   years after the riots, she helped create organizations and policies
   that support LGBTQIA+ rights.

   Today, we celebrate this movement every June during Pride Month. Pride
   is not just about parades and celebrations. It's about recognizing the
   power and resilience of the LGBTQIA+ community. Pride is about family,
   community, accepting ourselves, being visible and embracing who we are.
   It reminds us that everyone has the right to be themselves and be
   treated with respect.

   At the University of Pittsburgh and beyond, being able to express our
   true selves is important. It allows us to be innovative, relevant and
   sustainable. When we can be our authentic selves, it brings diversity
   to our workspaces, enables us to ask important questions, speak up and
   make positive changes.

   Pride encourages us to break free from the stereotypes and biases that
   limit us. It reminds us that our identities are complex and should be
   celebrated. Sometimes society tries to make us fit into one narrow box,
   but Pride encourages us to be who we are meant to be — not just survive
   but thrive.

   Pride is for everyone, not just LGBTQIA+ individuals. Stretch yourself
   to come together, support one another and work towards a world where
   everyone is treated equally. How can you do this in your space and
   place of work? While we should practice LGBTQIA+ inclusion throughout
   the year, June offers many opportunities at Pitt and in the region to
   get involved and show support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

15 Subtle Signs of Pride In Your Life

   How do you measure pride in your life? This article provide 15 not so
   obvious ways to assess the level of pride present in our lives.

   I STRUGGLE WITH PRIDE! There, I said it! Many of us would like to think
   of ourselves as humble individuals. But the more you walk with Jesus
   the more He shows you the areas you need to grow in. You might be
   surprised to know that there are many ways that pride can creep into
   our lives and I want to caution us all to be on guard against these. I
   think it’s safe to say that God HATES pride because it reminds Him of
   the original sin in heaven when Lucifer sinned and became Satan (Eze.
   28:12-15; Isa. 14:12-15; Rev. 12:1-3). The following is a checklist of
   15 indicators as to how pride can manifest itself in our lives. As you
   read this I encourage you to take an honest assessment as to whether
   these actions or mentalities are consistently manifested in your life.
   Here we go!


#1 – Assuming you already know something when someone is teaching

   When you immediately tune someone out who starts teaching you something
   that you may be somewhat familiar with, that is an example of pride. It
   is the assumption that you know everything about the subject being
   communicated and that this person, whom you see as inferior in
   knowledge to you, cannot teach you something new.


#2 – Seeing yourself as too good to perform certain tasks

   When someone asks you to do something and your immediate thought is,
   “I, out of all people, shouldn’t have to do that. That task is for
   someone else.” That is a sign of pride that we should consider dealing
   with. Next time this thought arises ask yourself,

     If Jesus was willing to leave heaven and come to earth for me, then
     who am I to say I am too good to do what someone asks me to do?


#3 – Being too proud to ask for help

   There is something to be said for independence. However, there are
   times in life when we must all admit that something is beyond our
   capacity and that we need help. The unwillingness to recognize our own
   shortcomings and need for help is a sign of pride.


#4 – Feeling the Need to Consistently Teach People Things

   Have you ever been in a group where someone feels the needs to dominate
   the conversation and seemingly spill everything they know without
   giving other people the opportunity to share? Sometimes this can be a
   sign of pride because when a person knows something that they know most
   other people don’t know much about, it creates a sense of pride within
   them.


#5 – Talking about Yourself a Lot

   When you talk a lot about your accomplishments, your education, title,
   position, and/or financial status, that is a sign of pride. The Bible
   says, “Be quick to listen and slow to speak…” (James 1:19). When we
   talk about ourselves a lot it reveals that we have not yet learned how
   to come up out of ourselves and focus on the interests of others (Phil.
   2:3).


#6 – Thinking You are Better Than Others Who are Different or Less Fortunate

   This one is subtle because a person can appear to be humble and caring
   on the outside. However, in their minds they secretly think they are
   better than other people who may have different backgrounds, cultures
   or experiences than they do.


#7 – When You Disregard the advice of others

   This has its root in thinking you have all the answers to life and you
   somehow don’t need or see the value in other people’s perspectives. It
   carries the idea that you believe you can be successful and accomplish
   your goals without the counsel of others.


#8 – When You are Consistently Critical

   This is when we tend to put others down often because there is a
   deep-seated need for us to feel better about ourselves. People who are
   critical are that way because they secretly see themselves as exempt
   from the very same things they criticize others. This is pride.


#9 – Consistent need for Attention and Affirmation

   When someone constantly needs to be the center of attention in public
   or secretly craves consistent affirmation for their accomplishments,
   looks, personality, serving, intelligence, and/or physique, this is a
   sign of pride.


#10 – Unable to receive constructive criticism

   When a person struggles to allow other people to speak into their lives
   and provide helpful feedback it is a sign of pride because they are too
   blinded by their own pride to see the value in what someone is sharing
   with them and how it can help make them a better person.


#11 – Overly obsessed with their physical appearance

   Certainly you should take care of yourself and exercise. But when a
   person is constantly obsessed with how they look and they like to
   flaunt their figure/physique in front of others with the hopes that
   people will notice and gawk at them, this is vanity which is yet
   another form of pride.


#12 – Unwilling to submit to authority

   When a person is unwilling to submit to authority at work, church, at
   home or in any other relationship it is because deep within the person
   they believe they could make better decisions than the person God has
   placed over them. So, they submit outwardly but inwardly they struggle
   to accept the subordinate position they are in.


#13 – Ignoring people’s attempt to communicate with you

   Ooowee! Yep, when you consistently blow people off who text or email
   you, you are essentially minimizing the importance of this person and
   their communication and saying to yourself that they are not important
   enough to invest your precious time into. We all get busy but
   acknowledging a person’s attempt to connect sends the message of
   importance to the other person.


#14 – Justifying our Sin instead of admitting it

   When someone graciously points out a sin issue in your life and you get
   defensive and even start to justify it that is a dangerous place to be
   because if they’re using scripture to support then you are essentially
   saying that you know better than God.


#15 – Name-dropping


   When you consistently associate yourself with people who have prominent
   positions and publicly drop it in conversations in hopes that people
   will think you are equally as important as the people you associate
   yourself with, this is a very subtle form of pride.


SUMMARY

   Whew! So, as you can see pride is something that can creep into your
   life in various subtle ways. A great story in the Bible to study about
   pride is about a man named King Uzziah in 2 Chronicles 26. I encourage
   you read/study it in its entirety. Once again, I encourage you to check
   your heart against this list and ask God to help you identify some ways
   that you struggle with pride and how you can exhibit more humility in
   your life.

Subtle Signs of Pride in your Co-workers, Spouse, Family, Church Staff and
Everybody Else Around You

The Secretly Prideful Person
                           By Ronald McDonald
                           A friend told me the other day that I’m a very
                           prideful man, and I said to myself, "Dude's
                           just jealous". So I told my wife what he said
                           and she said, "Ah, come on. You're a humble
                           man. Seriously. You're not cocky and flashy and
                           arrogant and all that." But later that same
                           week, I was reading a book that said the most
                           prideful people aren’t usually the bragging
                           arrogant types. They’re the nice friendly
                           helpful ones at work.
                           That got me to thinking that maybe my
                           definition of pride wasn’t very complete. Now I
                           really wondered, What are examples of
                           pride? So, I googled “Signs of pride list” and
                           “Spiritual pride” and couldn’t believe what I
                           found. I was all over the list. I read about 40
                           articles and lists written by well-known
                           psychologists, theologians, pastors and even
                           the Wikipedia entry and consolidated them all
                           here. I put them into 4 groups; Pride of
                           Spirituality, Pride of Knowledge, Pride
                           of Power and Pride of Appearance. So I went
                           back to my wife and said, "Hey honey, I think I
                           found out the root of all of our problems in
                           marriage and work and ministry and all that.
                           ME!!! I'm the problem. Listen to this list of
                           signs of pride that I found." I started reading
                           my list to her and she laughed and said, "Wow!
                           You are prideful. I didn't know that's what
                           pride looked like." So I asked her to pray for
                           me. And then said, "Oh, and there were some
                           other signs that I found on the list." Her jaw
                           dropped as I read hers. She said, "Oh no! I
                           didn't realize I was so prideful either. Will
                           you pray for me too?"
                           God had been resisting me. It was like his palm
                           was firmly planted in my forehead as I walked
                           through life and it was really uncomfortable.
                           And it was constant. He doesn't bodyslam the
                           proud, he just resists them, but he gives grace
                           (free gifts that we didn't deserve or earn,
                           unmerited favor) to the humble. Could it be
                           that God is resisting you in your relationships
                           or business or church or whatever area of your
                           life? Only by pride comes contention.
                           There are about 24 different categories one
                           could be prideful in. Most people are pretty
                           humble in most categories and just prideful in
                           one or two. You’ll see your relatives, spouse,
                           boss, employees, friends and president all over
                           this list. But don't forget this. Pride is one
                           of the most destructive and heinous sins you
                           can commit.
                           My dad used to say, “The reason we shouldn’t
                           sin isn’t because the Bible says not to or
                           because it’s wrong or because we could get
                           caught or because it could mess up our future
                           or because we’ll miss out on blessings. No! We
                           should try not to sin because it hurts our
                           relationship with God.
                           Ever heard this? “Yeah, maybe I’ve got a little
                           pride. But if you want to get along with me
                           you’ve just got to grow a pair. It’s just the
                           way I am and you’ll just have to deal with it”.
                           For you to know you have even a little bit
                           of pride and not care about it, is to raise
                           your fist in God’s face and say, “Hey God, I
                           don’t care that I’m regularly walking and
                           living in this sin of pride and I’m okay with
                           not having all that great of a relationship
                           with you either”. If that’s you, then watch
                           out. God is resisting you and you have some
                           humiliation coming, which is the process of
                           becoming humble, because he loves you and those
                           around you so much. “God opposes, resists,
                           abhors, tears down, brings down. has scattered,
                           is scornful to, reprimands, will punish, is
                           angry at, every arrogant person, those who have
                           a proud look, those whose pride wells up,
                           arrogant scoffers. “The prideful man – ‬‭will
                           be brought low, humiliated, disgraced, doomed,
                           destroyed, humbled, will not go unpunished, was
                           deposed from his royal throne and his honor was
                           removed.” Prov 3:34,11:2, 16:5, 15:25, ‭29:23,
                           Ps. ‭18:27, 101:5, 119:21, Is.
                           2:11,12‬‭‬,10:12, 2 Chr. 32:25, Dan.‬ ‭5:20,
                           Luke 1:51, James 4:6. This is a really serious
                           thing.
                           We’ll never conquer pride, but if we know what
                           it looks like when it flares up, we can knock
                           it back down before too much damage is done. If
                           people can’t recognize what the signs of cancer
                           look like, then they'll never know they need
                           help. I hope this list helps you understand
                           what pride looks like as much as it's helped
                           me.

How They Define Pride
                           Our SELF or Ego is basically who we are as a
                           person. It’s not good or bad, it’s just what
                           makes us, us. Unhealthy pride happens when we
                           do or say things for the purpose of people
                           praising our SELF or for making our SELF feel
                           good or putting our SELF ahead of someone
                           else's SELF. Pride wants our SELF to be
                           praised, get glory, be worshiped and be highly
                           talked about, even when we’re not in the room.
                           Unhealthy pride can give us an elevated view of
                           our own SELF that is not accurate, but we truly
                           start to believe it and act to reinforce what
                           we've come to believe as true. And when someone
                           questions or challenges the view of our SELF as
                           not accurate, the fireworks begin.
                           Here are some of the definitions of pride I
                           found
                              - Pride is being SELF-ish
                              - Thinking excessively about SELF
                              - Pride’s base is too much SELF-love
                              - Thinking the worth of our SELF is higher
                                than it actually is
                              - SELF-worship
                              - Preoccupation with our image or SELF
                              - Pride is narcissism (in love with our
                                image or SELF)
                              - Pride is SELF-centered or EGO-centric
                                (everything revolves around us)
                              - Pride wants to keep the focus on SELF
                              - SELF-ness
                           "Satan disguises submission to himself under
                           the ruse of personal autonomy. He never asks us
                           to become his servants. Never once did the
                           serpent say to Eve, 'I want to be your Master'.
                           The shift in commitment is never from Christ to
                           evil; it is always from Christ to self. And
                           instead of his will, self-interest now rules
                           and what I want reigns. And that is the essence
                           of sin." - Dennis F. Kinlaw (1922 - 2017)
                           “Instead of being motivated by SELF-ish
                           ambition or vanity, each of you should, in
                           humility (THE OPPOSITE OF PRIDE OR SELF-ISH),
                           be moved to treat one another as more important
                           than your SELF. Each should be concerned not
                           only about your own interests, but about the
                           interests of others as well.” Philippians 2:3-4
                           “Jesus said to him, ‘Love the Lord your God
                           with all your heart, with all your soul and
                           with all your mind. This is the first and
                           greatest commandment. The second is like it:
                           Love your neighbor as you love your SELF. All
                           the law and the prophets depend on these two
                           commandments’ “Matthew 22:37-39
                           “Love is patient, love is kind, it is not
                           envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed
                           up. It is not rude, it is not SELF-serving, it
                           is not easily angered or resentful." (All
                           the negatives are symptoms of pride) I
                           Corinthians 13:4-5
                           The same list of examples of what pride looks
                           like, is here twice, one after the other. The
                           first list immediately below does not have much
                           explanation attached to the signs of pride.
                           Further down the page is the same list, but
                           with a much fuller explanation of each sign of
                           pride with some links to deeper
                           explanations. If you don’t agree, then google
                           “pride defensiveness” or "pride depression” or
                           “pride low self esteem” or “pride critical” to
                           learn why so many people consider it a sign of
                           pride. But be careful not to judge a person's
                           heart because of their actions or words. You
                           can't always tell. A friend of mine, who is a
                           huge servant and genuinely humble, told me that
                           when he serves others, he usually thinks to
                           himself, "I sure hope they feel cared for and
                           loved". But now and then he serves and says, "I
                           bet they think I'm quite the servant. I bet
                           they think I'm humble". Don't try to play God
                           and judge the heart.

Pride of Spirituality
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re spiritual
                           Asceticism - They reject money, pleasure, joy,
                           fame or possessions (They mistakenly think God
                           likes that)
                             1. Brag about how NOT materialistic they are
                             2. Excessively give away nice possessions or
                                money that God gives them
                             3. Tell everyone, “I gave up a high paying
                                career to do this ministry”
                             4. Make excuses for the physical blessings in
                                their life
                             5. Look down their SELF righteous noses at
                                the wealthy or successful
                           Super Christians
                             1. Spiritualize every conversation
                             2. Speak with a different accent or voice
                                about spiritual stuff
                             3. Think they’re more spiritual or righteous
                                than others around them
                             4. Feel morally superior
                             5. Despise and detest sinners
                             6. Insist on having certain roles in the
                                church that they're disqualified or not
                                qualified for, just to prove to people
                                that they're spiritual
                             7. Talk a lot about their spiritual
                                gift of apostle or prophet, but not about
                                the less public ones
                             8. Talk about how much they pray
                             9. Look down on or badmouth Christians or
                                other denominations who believe
                                differently than they do about spiritual
                                gifts
                            10. Talk about their fasting SO THAT people
                                know they're fasting “When you fast, do
                                not look sullen like the hypocrites, for
                                they make their faces unattractive SO
                                THAT people will see them fasting. I tell
                                you the truth, they have their
                                reward.”Matthew 6:16
                           Prayer isn’t from the heart  “Whenever you
                           pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because
                           they love to pray while standing in synagogues
                           and on street corners SO THAT people can see
                           them. Truly I say to you, they have their
                           reward.” Matthew 6:5
                             1. Rehearse or spruce up their public
                                prayers using different words and
                                phrases that they would never say when
                                praying alone
                             2. Talk to the people when they say they are
                                praying to God. ie. Give mini-sermonettes,
                                remind the audience of the week's
                                schedule, etc.
                             3. Say, "I'll pray for that" when they
                                absolutely have no intention of praying
                                for it. But it sounds spiritual for sure.
                           False Humility - Humility is seeing yourself
                           and what you do the way it actually is. Pride
                           is not seeing yourself or what you do the way
                           it actually is.
                             1. Don’t accept compliments, but instead say,
                                "Thank you but no. It was all God" (If it
                                were all God, it would have been WAY
                                better than you did it)
                             2. Say that they’re lower and worse than
                                everyone else
                             3. Tell you that they’re humble, “In my
                                humble opinion”

Pride of Knowledge
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re smart
                           Unteachable
                             1. Get irritated if someone tries to teach
                                them something
                             2. Know it all
                             3. Answer “I know, I know” or “Yeah, I
                                already knew that”
                             4. Too smart for a formal education or
                                training. “But what could I learn?”
                           Highly opinionated
                             1. Often interrupt people mid-sentence “I
                                don’t mean to interrupt, but…”
                             2. Finish other people’s sentences “I know
                                what you're going to say. You were going
                                to say...”
                             3. Often try to prove people wrong
                             4. If questioned they say, “Don’t you think I
                                know what I’m doing?”
                             5. Don’t listen to the ideas or wisdom of
                                those they lead
                             6. Use big words and then explain them to you
                             7. Despise and detest people of other
                                political beliefs
                           Defensive when corrected or criticized - If you
                           ever get defensive in marriage, then you have
                           pride and it has to be dealt with. We think the
                           best defense is a great offense when our pride
                           is hurt. “With pride comes only
                           contention...”Proverbs‬ ‭13:10
                             1. Attack back when questioned or confronted
                                about a mistake or wrong

                                (because they think it reflects bad on
                                them)
                             4. Refuse to or are slow to say, “I was
                                wrong. Will you forgive me?”
                             5. Blame everyone else but themselves
                             6. Set up excuses in advance so it isn’t
                                their fault
                             7. Lie or make up excuses when corrected or
                                criticized
                             8. Say things like, “Everybody makes
                                mistakes. Heck, you make mistakes too”
                           Argumentative - Just have to be right
                             1. Don’t discuss differences to learn, just
                                to show off how much they know
                             2. "Told you so". Remind you about when they
                                were right and you were wrong
                             3. Get the last word
                             4. Argue strange, hard to defend beliefs or
                                doctrines to impress with their intellect
                           Critical - Highlight other’s flaws to make
                           their SELF feel better
                             1. Quick to correct or criticize spouses,
                                kids, pastors and other leaders
                             2. Criticize with no intention of building up
                                or improving the situation

                             5. Don’t show much mercy
                             6. Mean spirited

Pride of Power
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re capable. “But once he became powerful,
                           his pride destroyed him. He disobeyed the LORD
                           his God...” ‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭26:16‬
                           Controlling - Being obeyed gives their SELF a
                           nice feeling, sense of power
                             1. Excessively taking care of and shielding
                                their older children

                                irresponsibility
                             3. Manipulate to keep their adult
                                children close
                             4. Try to control or sway their adult
                                children’s marriages
                             5. Use women and keep them hanging on
                             6. Throw their wedding ring, threaten to
                                boycott events, scream, threaten divorce,
                                withhold affection or hit
                           Legalistic - Control through excessive rules -
                           their SELF feels really nice when they
                           are obeyed
                             1. Don’t want kids to rebel mostly so that
                                the parent’s SELF or Image isn’t
                                tarnished
                             2. Must have the appearance of spirituality
                                in strict dress codes and grooming
                             3. King James Version is the only version you
                                can read (huge red flag)
                             4. Hold to a few chosen Old Testament laws
                             5. No movies with magic in them, no alcohol,
                                cigars, dancing, playing cards, secular
                                music, tattoos, piercings, no Halloween
                                and absolutely no work on Sundays (except
                                for pastors and church staff, of course)
                           Won’t submit - It makes their SELF falsely
                           feel inferior if they have a positional
                           leader, though it has nothing to do with
                           wisdom, knowledge or ability.
                             1. Want the autonomy to decide how to live
                                their life, so won’t submit or surrender
                                to God. “God opposes the proud, but he
                                gives grace to the humble. So submit to
                                God. But resist the devil and he will flee
                                from you. Draw near to God and he will
                                draw near to you.” James‬ ‭4:5-8
                             2. Hate being told to do anything
                             3. Will submit in the little things, but not
                                in the big things
                             4. Church members won't submit to church
                                leaders
                             5. Citizens won't submit to government
                             6. Wives won't submit to husbands
                             7. Children won't submit to parents
                             8. Employees won't submit to employers. They
                                like to spell BOSS backwards. Double S-O-B
                           Self Reliant - Don’t want or think they need
                           guidance, help or wisdom from God or man. “When
                           they were fed, they became satisfied; when they
                           were satisfied, they became proud; as a result,
                           they forgot me!”Hosea‬ ‭13:6‬
                             1. Independence
                             2. Fear or worry a lot because they
                                depend on their own abilities
                             3. Hate to rely on others
                             4. Think their abilities are superior to

                                them. I often wonder if people who drive

                           Low SELF-esteem or SELF-worth - Humility is
                           seeing your own SELF the way it actually is.
                           Pride is not seeing your own SELF the way it

                             1. Constantly thinking of their SELF and what
                                others think about it

                           Focus on SELF and believing what’s not true
                           about their SELF is a very common one. Pride is
                           a major cause of depression for hundreds of
                           millions of people (much more about why this is
                           here, on the second list)
                           Shyness - this isn’t about introvert or

                           Envious - think that when others have things
                           they don’t, it makes their SELF look bad. “For
                           where there is jealousy and SELF-ishness, there
                           is disorder and every evil practice...”

                                look good while neglecting family
                           Two things to remember:
                           1. Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just
                           reporting the facts, ma'am. These signs of
                           pride are what I found and copied down and
                           then consolidated here for your reading
                           pleasure. Most were on several of the lists.
                           2. If you only saw your SELF in a couple of
                           places on this list, then you just have a
                           little bit of cancer. You need to be desperate
                           for treatment. Everyone is infected with Pride.
                           Don't be okay with it. This is serious.
                            “But then Hezekiah and the residents of
                           Jerusalem humbled themselves and abandoned
                           their pride, and the LORD was not angry with
                           them for the rest of Hezekiah’s reign." ‭‭2
                           Chronicles‬ ‭32:26
                           “if my people who are called by my name humble
                           themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn
                           from their wicked ways, then I will hear from
                           heaven and will forgive their sin and heal
                           their land. NOW my eyes will be open and my
                           ears attentive to the prayer that is made in
                           this place.” 2 Chronicles‬ ‭7:14-15‬
                           “Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will
                           exalt you.” ‭‭James‬ ‭4:5
                           “But one who is humble, has a lowly spirit,
                           will gain honor, wisdom, be exalted, shown
                           favor, be listened to, receive grace” (free

Don’t Miss This. Super Important
                           “The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit
                           - O God, a humble and repentant heart you will
                           not reject.” Psalm 51:17
                           God is not after your perfect behavior. He is
                           after a humble spirit and a contrite heart. I
                           looked up what the word “contrite” meant and it
                           said, “repentant or remorseful”. When my wife
                           and I read the list and saw ourselves on it in
                           some places, we immediately pleaded with God to
                           help us keep our pride down and be more humble.
                           We don’t want it at all and we are really sorry
                           that we have been so prideful for so long. And
                           now we question ourselves all the time, “Is
                           what I’m about to say or what I just said,
                           prideful? Because we really don’t want to be
                           prideful, even though we still act pridefully.
                           But a lot less. This is exactly what God wants
                           from us. A humble spirit and a contrite heart.
                           "For thus says the High and Lofty One Who
                           inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell
                           in the high and holy place, with him who has a
                           contrite and humble spirit, To revive the
                           spirit of the humble, And to revive the heart
                           of the contrite ones.'" – Isaiah 57:15

Three Pride Illustrations

Fighter in the Ring
                           We are in a fight with Prideman, a 600 lb 1%
                           body fat former Navy Seal, who has us by
                           the ankles slamming us down over and over
                           again. It’s a tag team match and God is
                           reaching his hand in there for us to tag so he
                           can fight for us, but he won’t tag us. But we
                           keep on saying, “No, I’m alright God. I’ve got
                           this, but would you mind helping me by
                           squirting some water in my mouth next time
                           around?” as Prideman keeps slamming us over and
                           over again. There may be 21 of the pride
                           categories where we don’t struggle, but one
                           area where we do. I encourage you to be
                           Humbleman and tag God’s hand to wage war for
                           you in that category. “God, I’m ready for you
                           to fight Prideman instead of me. I can’t do it.
                           You need to take over completely.” That’s what
                           humble people say.
                           My SELF says, “No, I can handle this! I just
                           won’t be this way anymore! I’ll turn over a new
                           leaf!” This always fails. Only God can change
                           how I am … and He really, really wants to.
                           "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy
                           laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke
                           upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle
                           and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for
                           your souls." – Matt. 11:28-29
                           "Therefore humble yourselves under
                           the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you
                           in due time…" 1 Pet. 5:6

Pride Monster
                           Imagine you’re in a canoe and there is a big
                           pride sea-monster that never stops chasing you
                           and it wants to eat you and it’s coming up and
                           down in the water chasing right behind you. So
                           you paddle like crazy to not get bit. Imagine
                           you paddle super hard for a long time and you
                           get really far ahead of it and so you put down
                           your paddle and kick up your feet and take a
                           break. And that’s when the pride monster
                           catches up to you and bites you hard.

Two Dogs
                           Two hungry dogs and only one dish of food. The
                           dog who eats the most is the one who gets
                           stronger and wins the fight. Pridedog is more
                           aggressive and pushier than Humbledog and so
                           pushes Humbledog out of the way and eats all of
                           the food unless someone purposefully pulls back
                           on Pridedog’s chain. That is when Humbledog
                           eats all of the food and wins. Here are some
                           things you can do to feed Humbledog.
                              - Be thankful everyday by telling God 20
                                things you’re thankful for
                              - Compliment little things you like about
                                others around you
                              - Learn about others. Practice asking
                                people 5 questions. Maybe these. What’s
                                your name? How long have you lived here?
                                Why did you move here? What do you do? How
                                did you get interested in that?
                              - Share your pride struggles with people
                                close to you and ask them to pray for you
                                and to tell you when they see your signs
                                of pride.

How Extreme Pride Slips In
                           Particularly for public figures like pastors,
                           CEO’s, singers, athletes, actors and actresses,
                           pride slips in subtly and undetected. And after
                           several years of being innocently complimented
                           and praised, we start believing things about
                           our SELF (ego) that are over-inflated above
                           what is actually true. And that view of our
                           SELF begins to feel actual and normal. And then
                           we say and do things so that others think as
                           highly about us as we do. And we do that
                           because we deeply believe that how highly we
                           think about our SELF is accurate and true. We
                           start thinking more about our own SELF than the
                           SELFs of others around us. Did you know that
                           the career with the highest rate of adultery is
                           a pastor.

How Humility Happens to Hard People
                           They say that pride is the last thing to leave
                           before a lot of people come to Christ. They’re
                           tired of trying to fight it on their own and
                           when they’ve tried everything else and have
                           been humbled, then they turn to God. They say,
                           “God, I’ve got a problem with pride and I’m
                           asking that YOU wage war on it. I’ll stand
                           aside. Please fight it for me.” Until a person
                           gets to that point and is serious, Life’s not
                           going to be easy. It usually takes losing a
                           spouse, the kids, a job or a few nights in the
                           car before someone raises their hand and says,
                           “Hi, my name is Ronald McDonald and I’m a
                           pride-a-holic and I need help.”
                           Self-Centered Churches and Man Boobs
                           I was listening to a non faith based marriage
                           book the other day and the author said that
                           Narcissism and Grandiosity (both forms of
                           pride) are a huge problem in America. A lot of
                           it started in the early 1970’s when personal
                           trainers and tons of self help books became
                           super common.  “You can do it. You’ve got what
                           it takes. You are worth it. There are no
                           losers. We don’t keep score. We don’t give
                           grades. Everybody wins and everybody passes.”
                           We clearly live in a self-centered (prideful)
                           society. So how wouldn’t that not bleed into
                           the church? Most churches rightly have the
                           slogan “To know God and make him known”, but
                           rarely do sermons magnify God. In other words,
                           make God look bigger and clearer so we know him
                           better. In my experience, there are more
                           self-help type sermons about how to become a
                           better Christian than there are about what God
                           is like. Most songs are about us worshiping
                           rather than about God being worshipped and
                           stats say that only 2% of people have ever led
                           someone to faith in Christ. Evangelism is a
                           rare thing because not many are concerned about
                           the SELF of others more than they are their own
                           SELF. (More about this paragraph later.)
                           So if God is not very much the focus of our
                           teachings nor our worship, then it makes sense
                           that 85% of youth who grow up in church, stop
                           going to church when they leave home. Because
                           they don’t know very well what God is like,
                           they don’t really like him that much. If they
                           knew the God that I know, they would want 10 of
                           him in their lives.
                           Essential Oils and Man Boobs
                           I recently read a study to my family that said
                           Lavender and Tea Tree Oil probably cause man
                           boobs to grow on prepubescent boys. My 10 year
                           old son’s eyes got as big as saucers and we all
                           started to laugh because we have Tea Tree and
                           Lavender shampoo and conditioner out in the
                           shower. He immediately stopped using it just in
                           case the study were true.
                           So the question came up, since my wife is so
                           into essential oils, why would anyone use those
                           oils on prepubescent boys when there are
                           hundreds of other scents that smell similar or
                           do the same thing (if they even do anything)?
                           Is the reward of what Tea Tree and Lavender
                           give you worth the risk of man boobs? Why do
                           anything even closely similar. And if a study
                           said there were an essential oil that
                           eventually would give you the strength and
                           stamina and the heart of a stallion if you rub
                           a drop on your chest once a week, you can bet
                           I’d be slathering it on there every few days.
                           If you knew for sure that it couldn’t hurt? Why
                           wouldn’t you? But if it could possibly be the
                           wrong thing to do, why even try it?
                           You can’t go wrong having a church that is
                           focused on knowing and magnifying God each and
                           every week in sermons and song, but you could
                           go wrong focusing on our SELF most of the time
                           and God sometimes.
                           I was talking with a worship leader from Canada
                           and he agreed. He said we live in a society
                           plagued with individualism. He said that if we
                           went back in time a hundred years ago, people
                           would think we were crazy and self-centered if
                           we lived like we do now. But it’s become
                           normal.
                           Self-Help Churches
                           So many churches have turned into Self Help
                           Churches. “We won’t talk about your sin here
                           because that would be telling you that you’re
                           wrong or not in a good state. Instead, here are
                           all of the things you can get out of God for
                           your SELF if you accept Christ. You’ll be
                           happier. You can go to Heaven. You can have an
                           abundant life. You can be powerful, but I’m not
                           saying that you’re not already powerful and
                           really important, but you could be even more so
                           if you give your life to Christ. You can be
                           healthy. You can be wealthy. You can get peace,
                           even in storms. And joy too. You can have a
                           healthy community. Today can be the first day
                           of the rest of your life. “I’ll see you at the
                           top”. These are all good things you’ll learn in
                           your Bible reading and in Bible study.
                           Heaven forbid we offend someone by telling them
                           that they’re on the wrong team and in need of
                           someone to save them from having to pay the
                           penalty of their sin because they aren’t
                           capable to do it by themselves. You would now
                           be considered a toxic person.
                           And then, once they’re on the team, they hear,
                           “Here’s how YOU can be a better Christian. How
                           YOU can forgive more. How YOU can be kinder.
                           Here’s how YOU can be more servantlike. How YOU
                           can be more loving. How YOU can be more
                           Christlike. Here’s how YOU can be more
                           merciful. Here’s how YOU can be more filled
                           with grace.” Here’s how you can have more
                           faith. Here’s how you can get more power. Here
                           are 5 steps to getting more out of the Holy
                           Spirit. POWER. P - plead O - optimism W - weep
                           E - earn it R - reward.
                           Self-Centered Songs
                           Note here: This seems logical to me, but I’m
                           still not exactly sure what to think about
                           this.
                           Here are definitions of Praise and Worship from
                           the dictionary.
                           Praise - To express warm approval or admiration
                           of (usually for an act).
                           Worship - The feeling or expression of
                           reverence and adoration for a deity.
                           If there were a music video of the “Praise and
                           Worship” song we’re singing on Sunday morning,
                           who would the camera be focused on most? Would
                           it be focused on me on a mountaintop with my
                           hands raised to Heaven as I talked about how I
                           was singing to Him and how I can’t stop singing
                           and how I raise my voice to do it and how
                           nobody can stop me from singing? Would it be me
                           looking into a mirror admitting that I am not
                           worthy of Him? Me on my knees praying to God
                           asking for strength and courage and endurance
                           and more of his power and love in me? Or would
                           it be focused on our all wise and patient God
                           who is kind in all of his works and on our
                           loving and compassionate Jesus on the cross and
                           about how powerful of a creator he is. Or Is
                           God sitting on his throne tapping his fingers
                           saying to himself, “I wonder when I get a
                           song”?
                           I analyzed the top 40 most sung songs in
                           churches according to CCLI and highlighted the
                           parts that magnified or talked about God’s
                           attributes or character in some way. This is
                           what I found.
                           9 songs - almost 100% focused on God.
                           10 songs - 50% of the words were about God and
                           50% about the worshiper.
                           12 songs - 25% of words were about God and 75%
                           focused on the worshiper.
                           9 songs - mentioned God with only 3 to 8 words
                           and focused on the worshiper with the rest.
                           There may be a place for a warm up song or two.
                           A prayerful song. A song to get us into the
                           right posture for Worshipping and Praising
                           God.  I’m not sure. But remember this, just
                           because it’s on the radio doesn’t mean it’s a
                           worship song. Because it’s a Psalm, doesn’t
                           mean that is a worship song. Imagine singing
                           “Break the teeth of my enemies, oh God” in
                           church. It’s just a nice song that God inspired
                           them to write to build up and encourage
                           believers. We can worship in a lot of ways,
                           like in giving money, working hard etc.
                           Sometimes, even a secular song will get me
                           focused on God and I’ll worship Him in that.
                           But like the essential oils, if there are so
                           many hundreds of songs that magnify and praise
                           God, why not pick one of those instead of the
                           warm up songs? There is no way we could go
                           wrong singing songs about all of the things
                           that we love about God. But WHAT IF God
                           considers our ME songs as self-centered? What
                           if he does tap his fingers while we sing to
                           ourselves?

Pride of Spirituality

Appearing Really Spiritual
                           People should be spiritually minded. God loves
                           that. It’s the way we’re supposed to be. But
                           when we want everybody to recognize and talk
                           about and praise us for how spiritually minded
                           we are, that’s not good. So we say and do
                           things for the purpose of reinforcing that
                           we’re spiritual, in their minds. The only
                           people Jesús was publicly against were those
                           who did and said things so that people would
                           think they were spiritual. The Pharisees prayed
                           fancy prayers, made it obvious they were
                           fasting, let everyone know when they tithed
                           etc. so that their image (SELF or ego) would be
                           raised up in the eyes of everyone around them.
                           And then praised for being so spiritual.

Rejection of Material Possessions
                           Rejection of Material Possessions Sometimes
                           with good intentions, people think that God is
                           pleased when we don’t have things of value.
                           Righteous living. And then in their pride can
                           say, “If only those materialistic people were
                           as righteous as I”.
                              - Reject money, fame, joy or pleasure (also
                                called Asceticism) monks (vows of
                                poverty), clergy, pastors, theologically
                                trained and missionaries are infamous for
                                this, while humble people accept God’s
                                blessings as a reward from Him. “I gave up
                                a really high paying corporate job to do
                                this ministry”.
                              - Brag about how few possessions they have
                                or how humbly they live so that people
                                will recognize they are not materialistic
                                and therefore very spiritual.
                              - Embarrassed or make excuses about owning
                                nice things or big houses.
                              - Look down their noses at the rich or at
                                those who have a lot of nice things
                              - Excessively generous partially out of
                                obedience to what God has put on their
                                hearts to do and partially for the purpose
                                of confirming in people’s minds that they
                                aren’t eating mammon for breakfast and are
                                still spiritually minded. They reject
                                God’s rewards or gifts to them and think
                                that that shows their commitment to God.
                                “Dang, that guy sure is committed to God.
                                I don’t think I could do or live like
                                that.”

Churchy Language and Prayers

Spiritualize everything
                              - They only talk about spiritual things so
                                that people will think they’re spiritual.
                              - Prideful people spruce up their public
                                prayers with churchy vocabulary or higher
                                volume that they never use when talking to
                                God alone, to make sure people recognize
                                that they’re spiritual. We’re not talking
                                about people who pray and are passionate
                                and their heart and personality come out
                                while praying. Be careful not to judge
                                one’s heart. But if prayers are changed so
                                that those listening are impressed with us
                                and think, “That guy is a real spiritual
                                man. He sure can pray”, then that’s always
                                pride.
                              - Practice their public prayers
                              - Prideful people often speak differently,
                                use a different accent or voice or put on
                                a different face or behavior to help
                                people recognize that they’re spiritual.
                                Walking and pacing and flailing the arms
                                is not wrong if it’s for presentation or
                                for a purpose. Again, be careful not to
                                think you can judge the thoughts and
                                intents of someone else’s heart. Only God
                                can do that.
                              - They think they’re more spiritual than
                                spouses and church members.

False Humility
                           Prideful people fake their humility. They try
                           extra hard to be humble for the purpose of
                           people thinking that they’re humble so they’ll
                           be praised for being so humble. A very humble
                           friend of mine, who serves everybody ahead of
                           himself, confessed to me that every once in a
                           while he does something really selfless and
                           servant-like and walks away saying to himself,
                           “I bet they think I’m pretty humble”. That’s
                           not True Humility. It’s called False Humility.
                           It’s just a matter of the heart.
                              - Prideful put themselves down as if they
                                are lower than everybody else. This may
                                even flow from a genuine desire for
                                humility, but humility is seeing your SELF
                                the way you accurately are. Pride is
                                seeing your SELF NOT the way you actually
                                are.
                              - Treat themselves badly - “I am not worthy”
                                or “I’m a loser”.
                              - Prideful people don’t easily accept
                                compliments. They put one hand in front of
                                you like they’re stopping traffic and with
                                the other they point to the heavens while
                                vigorously shaking their head and mouthing
                                the words, “No no no - God, God”. If
                                someone says that to you, you can say to
                                them, “That really seemed like it was all
                                you. If it had been God, then it would
                                have been WAY better than that”. Their
                                pride wants those watching to say, “Whoa,
                                that guy is humble. He must be really
                                spiritual”. The right response would be to
                                say something that is actually true,
                                “Thank you. That was very kind of you to
                                say. God has given everybody gifts and I
                                believe this is what he gave me”. Or,
                                “It’s easy to do good work when God
                                surrounds me with some great people.” or
                                “Thank you for the kind words. Mom and Dad
                                made me take lessons for years and
                                years.”
                              - Prideful people skillfully brag in a
                                humble way. “Can you believe how great God
                                is. They asked me to speak at the Prayer
                                Breakfast again.” or “Please pray for my
                                church. We don’t know how to handle all of
                                the growth.” They brag about their work,
                                accomplishments, ministry, earnings etc.
                                because if they just flat out bragged
                                about their SELF, they wouldn’t look too
                                spiritual.
                              - Prideful people tell you they’re humble
                                and say, “In my humble opinion”.
                              - Only confess insignificant sins - Prideful
                                people confess little sins and say things
                                like, “I really struggle with coveting my
                                neighbor’s old Toyota Land Cruiser
                                everytime I drive by their house.” As if
                                that’s as bad as their sin gets, so you
                                think they’re spiritual.
                              - They take a lot of pleasure in
                                SELF-rightness feelings of being morally
                                superior to most other Christians, which
                                makes them feel better about their own
                                failings.

Pride of Knowledge
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re smart
                           “The wise person accepts instructions, but the
                           one who speaks foolishness will come to ruin.”

Unteachable
                           I asked a friend of mine, who wanted to start a
                           church, if he had considered formally studying
                           the Bible. He looked at me and asked, “But what
                           could I learn?” He felt he knew everything
                           already.
                              - Prideful people say they don’t need to be
                                trained or educated because that would
                                mean their SELF wasn’t capable enough to
                                be successful without someone’s help.
                                Prideful people want to say, “I became a
                                successful and accomplished self-made man
                                by myself. I didn’t need anyone to teach
                                me anything because I’m that smart or
                                capable. I’m sure you’re impressed with
                                me”.
                              - Prideful people think they have all the
                                answers to life and somehow don’t need or
                                see the value in other people’s
                                perspectives.
                              - They are know-it-all’s and say, “I already
                                knew that”.
                              - They are highly opinionated and
                                argumentative.
                              - Use big words knowing that they will
                                probably have to explain what they mean.
                              - Irritated if someone tries to teach them
                                something because that makes their SELF
                                feels ignorant.

Not Genuinely Interested in Other People
                              - They don’t ask questions to learn about
                                people because they aren’t interested in
                                other people more than they’re interested
                                in their own SELF. So why would they want
                                to know how many kids a person has, if
                                their parents are still alive, what parts
                                of work they enjoy or their favorite past
                                times?
                              - Dominate conversations with talk of
                                themselves or about the subject at hand to
                                impress you so you think they’re smart.
                              - Though credentials and titles are
                                sometimes necessary to establish authority
                                so they’ll listen to or negotiate with
                                you, prideful people insist on a lofty
                                title or talk a lot about their
                                credentials so that others will be more
                                impressed and think more highly of them.

Poor Listeners
                              - Interrupt people mid-sentence. I once knew
                                a con-man who used to regularly interrupt
                                me and say, “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to
                                interrupt but…” And he conned me.
                              - Hear out people’s ideas and nod their
                                head, with no intention of using their
                                idea.
                              - Finish others’ sentences or say, “I know
                                what you’re going to say. You’re going to
                                say….”
                              - Open their mouth kind of and make slight
                                noises with their lips and act like
                                they’re going to start talking so you stop
                                talking so they can start. If you pause
                                mid-thought to take a breath, they start
                                talking.
                              - Assume they know all there is about the
                                subject and so tune out
                              - Don’t listen to those they lead
                              - Prideful people listen to others just to
                                see if they can fix them or bless and
                                impress them with their wisdom and
                                knowledge.

Argumentative
                           Prideful people argue strange, new or
                           uncommonly held beliefs or doctrines and argue
                           them well so that people are impressed with
                           their intellect.
                              - They get the last word
                              - Prideful people don’t discuss their
                                differences with the hope of possibly
                                learning something. They argue to show how
                                much they know.
                              - Prideful people don’t hesitate confronting
                                someone to say what they think is right.
                              - They can’t handle being wrong.
                              - Argue and hold to strange or uncommonly
                                held beliefs. To show that they can argue
                                and should be respected for their ability
                                to argue. Flat Earth, The Millenium has
                                already past. Moon landing was fake. Note:
                                There are exceptions though. Like I
                                genuinely believe in Bigfoot. There’s just
                                too much evidence. And I once saw Nessie’s
                                shadow in Loch Ness from way up high, but
                                my wife doesn’t believe me.

Critical
                           Helpful or constructive criticism is used by
                           God in our lives to build us up and make us
                           more fruitful. And a lot of people can be
                           critical only because they want to help us
                           improve. The key is how we deliver that
                           criticism and that we do it sparingly. We need
                           to ask ourselves, “Would it make a difference
                           if I critique this?” If it won’t, then just let
                           it go. A good practice is to ask permission to
                           give the criticism, “Would you like a thought
                           about how to make that even better?”
                           Unnecessary criticism is just mean. It tears
                           down, doesn’t help and makes people feel bad.
                           It is usually based in poor self-worth and
                           shame. Prideful people measure themselves
                           against others. When someone near them does a
                           good thing, it makes their SELF feel inferior,
                           and so they tear them down for no reason other
                           than to make their SELF feel better. When we
                           put the spotlight on other’s flaws, that’s a
                           defense that puts the shortcomings of our SELF
                           in the shadows.
                              - Quick to correct or criticize their
                                spouse, kids, pastor, teacher, youth
                                pastor or others in leadership positions.
                              - Negative all the time. Complain a lot
                                about the weather, their health,
                                circumstances, job, church.
                              - Tear others down by joking or teasing
                                harshly
                              - Always give the punishment deserved
                                instead of showing mercy

Pride of Power
                           Thinking that they’re more important than
                           others or trying to make sure people think
                           they’re capable.

Pride and a Controlling Nature
                           Here is a comprehensive article full of
                           psychobabble about why the need to control,
                           feel superior and be mean to others is such a
                           huge sign of
                           pride.http://mindrenewal.us/page6.html

Control
                           Control is trying to give yourself security.
                           But remember, you are one cancer cell away from
                           being in control.
                              - Prideful people control their spouse,
                                children, friends and co-workers.
                              - Prideful parents create dependent children
                                by providing everything for them and not
                                letting them suffer the consequences of
                                their irresponsible actions. They want to
                                keep them around to be needed. A form of
                                control.
                              - Prideful people manipulate to get their
                                way by throwing their wedding ring across
                                the room or throw some sort of tantrum
                                whether it’s really quiet or really loud.
                                They try to condition you to go with their
                                idea everytime.
                              - Prideful people say it’s my way or no way.
                                They threaten to boycott the trip or
                                activity by saying, “Nevermind, I don’t
                                even want to go now” if they don’t get
                                their way.
                              - They purposefully drive slow in the fast
                                lane so they have control, not considering
                                that the person behind them who may have
                                an urgent matter.

Legalistic
                           Legalism is when a really religious sounding
                           person or people crave for their SELF to be
                           respected and praised through power and
                           control. They force their own questionable or
                           easily debatable standards and rules on their
                           followers. When people obey them, it makes
                           their SELF feel good. “It’s sin to wear shorts
                           like that or eat pork or watch movies that have
                           magic in them or drink beer or work on Sunday
                           or smoke cigars or play poker or say ‘darn or
                           gosh’ or get a tattoo or pierce your nose or
                           read any version of the Bible other than the
                           King James Version or or…. This form of Pride
                           has kept more people away from God than maybe
                           any other. I know so many people raised in
                           legalistic homes who now, as adults, mock
                           Christians and try to keep people from God.
                           Spiritually abusive people like this understand
                           that Christians won’t follow an arrogant
                           obviously proud person. So they cloak it in
                           religious churchy language and weak and
                           inconsistent biblical justifications. If it’s
                           not black and white in the New Testament, then
                           we are to follow the Holy Spirit’s leading, but
                           the legalistic leader wants us to follow their
                           leading instead. They argue it relentlessly so
                           you’ll obey and they’ll be dominant and their
                           SELF will feel important and be praised.
                              - They misinterpret and misuse the Bible to
                                justify their rules, but their real
                                interest is being right or having control.
                              - They don’t want their kids to look
                                rebellious on the outside because they
                                think that reflects bad on their own SELF
                                and then they will look bad. It’s about
                                appearing spiritual rather than being
                                spiritual.
                           They force their own questionable or easily
                           debatable standards and rules on their
                           followers. When people obey them, it makes
                           their SELF feel good. “It’s sin to wear shorts
                           like that or eat pork or watch movies that have
                           magic in them or drink beer or work on Sunday
                           or smoke cigars or play poker or say ‘darn or
                           gosh’ or get a tattoo or pierce your nose

Submission
                           Prideful people don’t submit easily and rebel
                           against their leaders, spiritual or secular and
                           falsely see it as a weaker position. God as our
                           leader. Wives against their husbands; children
                           against their parents; employees against their
                           bosses; citizens against their government. They
                           believe they can make better decisions than the
                           leader in their lives. And they often can, but
                           it’s not about that.
                           It’s not about the best decision, but it’s
                           about being a faithful follower. It’s important
                           that we share our ideas and wisdom and concerns
                           with those in authority over us and then help
                           make their decision into the best decision.
                           Leadership needs to say, “I’ve heard your idea
                           and their idea. We’re going with their idea. It
                           may not be the best idea, but let’s make it
                           into the best idea. The leader needs to be
                           humble and listen to those they lead,
                           especially when their initial thought wasn’t as
                           good as someone else’s.
                           Prideful people don’t like being told what to
                           do. This doesn’t mean to not question or share
                           wisdom with our leaders, but without a fight,
                           submit.

Hungry for Attention
                           Prideful people get hurt and resent it if they
                           aren’t made mention of and recognized for their
                           accomplishments, acts of service or
                           selflessness. They say and do things for
                           attention and say or do things so that people
                           take great notice of them and regard them
                           highly and talk about them when they’re not
                           there.
                           Prideful people lie. They don’t just embellish
                           a story to make it more entertaining but flat
                           out lie with numbers and circumstances to make
                           their SELF look better.

Self Reliance
                              - Fearful and worry a lot. They put more
                                faith in their plans and ability to take
                                care of themselves than in God to take
                                care of them. And therefore live in fear
                                that their plans will fail. Shows our lack
                                of trust in God and our self-reliance
                                because we are hugely preoccupied with our
                                SELF and don’t have control.
                              - Say they depend on God, but they don’t.
                                They depend on their own abilities.
                              - They hate to rely on others because they
                                believe that help to accomplish something
                                is a sign of weakness.
                              - Don’t often say thank you to God or man,
                                because that would be admitting they
                                needed help and won’t get total credit.
                              - Willing to help others, but not accept
                                help in the same area they helped
                              - Don’t need to pray much because they don’t
                                think they need the help, grace or
                                guidance
                              - Don’t think they need God’s help,
                                direction, grace, courage or hope. So why
                                pray?

Take Credit for Things
                              - Prideful people lie to take credit for
                                things they didn’t do.
                              - Prideful people don’t give compliments or
                                credit to people who deserve it because
                                they think it makes them look bad in
                                contrast.
                              - Don’t like to share praise with others
                              - Prideful people don’t need to pray because
                                that would mean God did it and they
                                wouldn’t get credit for it.
                              - Prideful people shoot down other people’s
                                good ideas because it wasn’t their own and
                                even condition others to eventually stop
                                sharing ideas. They make fun of them or
                                roll their eyes or tell them that they are
                                not wise for saying that.

Workaholic
                           Prideful people are serve or work obsessed,
                           addicted to power and control in a compulsive
                           drive to gain approval and public recognition
                           of success. They believe that their SELF or
                           image, the prestige and status and general
                           emotional well-being they get from being
                           praised for their work or service, is so much
                           more important than the SELF or emotional
                           well-being of their spouse and kids.

                              - Prideful people in leadership positions
                                don’t delegate as often as they should
                                because no one can do it as well or as
                                quickly as they could.

Crave Importance
                           Prideful people feel and believe that value is
                           added to their SELF because of their status or
                           accomplishments. They feel that they are worth
                           more by doing or appearing a certain way.
                              - Purposefully make people wait on them.
                                They seem to enjoy the power of everyone
                                waiting for them. They are regularly late
                                for appointments and meetings that can’t
                                start without them. They like feeling
                                control even though they know they’re
                                causing others to fall behind in their own
                                schedules or are keeping them from
                                important matters. I know a con man who
                                regularly made his wife wait in the car
                                for lunch, sometimes up to three hours
                                beyond when they had agreed. His wife told
                                my wife, “He’s the proudest man I know”.

Overachiever Pride
                              - Sometimes when a child didn’t feel
                                unconditionally loved by their parents or
                                guardians just for who they were, but only
                                for how they performed, then life is a
                                competition to not just do their best, but
                                to do things better than everybody else so
                                they can prove that they are worthy of the
                                love of their parents and friends.

Low Self Esteem
                           True humility isn’t thinking less of your SELF,
                           but thinking of your SELF less. Here is a great
                           psychobabble article about why low self esteem
                           and depression is a huge sign of pride.
                           Humility is seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Knowing what is true about who you
                           are. If you are a naturally gifted musician or
                           have become excellent at tennis through years
                           of hard work, then it’s right to acknowledge
                           that because those are things that are true
                           about your SELF. If humble people are not very
                           good at managing people or not very coordinated
                           or don’t have much fashion sense, they are
                           comfortable admitting it because it’s true
                           about their SELF.
                           Pride is NOT seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Not believing what is accurate and
                           true. If you’re a physically attractive person
                           but tell everyone that you’re ugly or if you
                           have a very likable personality but say that
                           people don’t like you, then that is pride
                           because it isn’t true. Prideful people who
                           aren’t very good at coming up with creative
                           marketing ideas or who are clearly not very
                           good at leading people, won’t stop insisting
                           that they are and are offended if someone
                           speaks the truth to them. Prideful people don’t
                           believe what is true about their SELF.
                              - Won’t ask for forgiveness because that
                                would mean that their SELF isn’t great and
                                was wrong and they are okay living in that
                                sin of not asking for forgiveness. Asking
                                for forgiveness is not dependent on the
                                other person admitting their wrongs too.
                              - Lie about accomplishments and sometimes
                                not just kind of lie, but they lie almost
                                beyond belief. They are desperate for us
                                to think highly of them.

Embarrassed easily
                           Embarrassment is a sign that pride is being
                           attacked.
                             1. Prideful people think they’re above doing
                                lowly tasks and immediately think, “I, of
                                all people, shouldn’t have to do that.
                                That task is for someone lower than
                                myself.”
                             2. Prideful people fear people seeing them
                                doing lowly tasks because they fear that
                                others will think they must not be very
                                powerful or important if they have to do a
                                lowly task.
                             3. Prideful people wait to be served and
                                don’t often serve others because they
                                don’t think of others as more important
                                than themselves.
                             4. Prideful people think they’re better than
                                others. This one can be hard to detect
                                because a person can appear to be humble
                                and caring on the outside.
                             5. Prideful people are easily offended when
                                others question their motives or ability
                                to do something. They say, “Don’t you
                                trust me” or “Don’t you think I know what
                                I’m doing?”
                             6. Depression - Always thinking about the bad
                                condition of their own SELF

Envy
                           When the prince of a kingdom chooses a princess
                           from a neighboring kingdom to be his bride,
                           everybody is happy for her. Nobody is envious.
                           If the prince chooses a local girl from his
                           kingdom to be his bride, then envy is strong
                           from all of the other local girls in the
                           kingdom.
                           Envy is the feeling of discontent or resentful
                           longing for somebody else’s career, good looks,
                           talent, job promotion, wisdom, fame, social
                           position, spirituality, character, sense of
                           humor, wealth, possessions or other status
                           symbols or positive qualities. By having those
                           things, they think they’ll show everybody that
                           the lie they have slowly come to believe about
                           their SELF is true. It is especially hard on
                           them when someone who is their equal rises
                           above them economically or in social standing.
                             1. Prideful people believe others are envious
                                of them because “wouldn’t everybody be
                                envious of what I’ve got?”
                             2. Prideful are envious when the spotlight is
                                on someone they feel they are superior to.
                                Then they whisper to the person next to
                                them, “They’re not all that”.
                             3. Prideful people sabotage other people’s
                                work or don’t use someone else’s good idea
                                because they think that if that person is
                                praised, then they will look lesser.

Materialism
                           Prideful people try to impress with their
                           success by showing us their possessions.
                           Prideful people are not generous with their
                           money. They are SELF-ish and would rather use
                           their money to buy things that they feel
                           validate their untrue feelings of who they
                           are.

Defensiveness
                              - Think the best defense is a great offense
                                when their SELF feels attacked (when their
                                pride is hurt).
                              - They condition people to NEVER confront
                                them again by attacking them back with
                                their past mistakes or failures so it
                                takes the focus off of the prideful
                                person’s problem.
                              - Prideful people make up excuses when
                                they’re corrected or criticized.
                              - Prideful people say things like,
                                “Everybody makes mistakes” or “you make
                                mistakes too” when they have no choice but
                                to accept blame.

Depression
                           There are a lot of legitimate medical and
                           traumatic reasons for depression. Focus on SELF
                           and believing what’s not true about their SELF,
                           is a common reason. Pride is a major cause of
                           depression for millions of people.

Shyness
                           We can be wired as introverts purposefully by
                           God from birth. This isn’t about introverts or
                           extroverts
                              - Prideful people are very shy. They are
                                overly concerned with others’ opinions of
                                them which is usually a reflection of
                                being obsessed with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t invite people to
                                their home because it’s not nice enough or
                                they can’t afford to entertain big.
                              - Prideful people have a hard time sharing
                                their real spiritual needs or other junk
                                because they’re afraid they won’t be liked
                                anymore.
                              - Prideful people fear what people will
                                think of them and are overly consumed with
                                man’s opinion of their SELF which is
                                usually a sign of obsession with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t like reaching out
                                and being friendly at church or in other
                                social settings.

Pride of Appearance
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re valuable and they believe their SELF is
                           more valuable if it looks good
                           Arrogance, Immodesty, Narcissism, Pomposity,
                           Pride, Self-Importance, Self-Love, Self-regard,
                           smugness, swagger, self-admiration,
                           self-exaltation, swelled head, conceited,
                           display, pretension, self-worship, show,
                           ostentation,
                           We should take healthy pride in our appearance
                           and do the best with what we’ve got and for our
                           spouse. Dignity is a good thing. But this is
                           not:

Understanding Why We Have Pride and How it Works
                           God wants us to be proud of our work or family
                           or to try the best with what we’ve got. And
                           when we’re recognized and affirmed for doing
                           well, it feels good and right. That’s healthy
                           pride. The apostle Paul said that he was
                           “proud” of some of the early churches.
                           When we’re supported, protected and affirmed
                           growing up, then that builds a solid firm
                           structure or base inside of us. It gives us a
                           STRONG ego, or good sense of what’s true about
                           our SELF. It’s a good and healthy thing. If we
                           weren’t supported, protected and affirmed, then
                           we often develop a BIG ego. And that’s no
                           bueno. Since a strong floor or structure wasn’t
                           built up inside of us to tell us what our SELF
                           is accurately worth, we have to guess at our
                           value or worth.
                           So we try to build up or inflate our SELF to
                           where we think a healthy place should be, but
                           usually over-inflate or prop it up way higher
                           than what is accurate by saying and doing
                           things to show others what we’ve guessed is
                           accurate about us. And that’s when the praise
                           and worship of us starts and that makes us
                           think that what we believe about our SELF is
                           true. Pride can even distort our mind to think
                           that even our junk is good and right.

Conclusion
                           I really hope this list and explanation has
                           helped you understand what pride really looks
                           like and has given you a desire to not have it
                           in your life. And remember, don’t shoot the
                           messenger.

   signs of pride

   ShareTweetPinPocketFlipboard

   It’s wise for us to be aware of signs of pride in ourselves.

41 Key Signs of Pride

    1. Do you look down on those who are less educated, less affluent,
       less refined or less successful than yourself?
    2. Do you think of yourself as more spiritual than your mate, others
       in your in your church?
    3. Do you have a judgmental spirit toward those who don’t make the
       same lifestyle choices you do…dress standards, how you school your

   12. Do you have a touchy, sensitive spirit? Easily offended? Get your
       feelings hurt easily?
   13. Are you guilty of pretense? Trying to leave a better impression of

   29. Are you more concerned about your problems, needs, burdens than

   38. Do you avoid being around certain people because you feel inferior

   39. Are you uncomfortable inviting people to your home because you
       don’t think it’s nice enough or you can’t afford to do lavish
       entertaining?
   40. Is it hard for you to let others know when you need help (practical
       or spiritual)?
   41. When is the last time you said these words to a family member,
       friend or coworker: “I was wrong; would you please forgive me?” (If
       it’s been more than a month, mark it down!)

   Are you sitting here thinking how many of these questions apply to
   someone you know? Feeling pretty good that none of these signs of pride
   really apply to you?

11 Signs You Are Prideful

   How do you know you are struggling with pride? What are the symptoms of
   being prideful? To help you answer these questions and get rid of pride
   in your heart, evaluate yourself by checking out the following signs:

1. You think you are humble.

   One of the signs that you are proud of is that you refuse to admit that
   you struggle with pride. Therefore, calling yourself “humble” is
   actually false humility.

   To avoid this, stop telling yourself—or others—that you are humble. If
   that is true, then let others acknowledge that.

2. You do not accept constructive criticisms.

   Proud people have a hard time accepting failures. For this reason, they
   refuse to be corrected. They are offended whenever their behaviors or
   outputs are scrutinized.

   Instead of being insulted, be thankful when others correct you because
   it will help you improve. But, remember, you are not perfect.

3. You always want to be the center of attention.

   One sign of being proud is when you always want attention and
   appreciation. You feel like you are the center of the universe, so
   everyone should turn their eyes and ears to you.

   If this is your case, then it is time to stop living in the illusion
   that everyone adores you. Do not think that you are more important than
   anyone else. Instead, try living a low-key life.

4. You are vain about your physical appearance.

   Being obsessed about making yourself attractive is another hint of
   pride creeping into you. In connection with no. 3, vanity makes you
   flaunt your beauty, hoping that everyone will admire you.

   It is okay to take care of yourself and evaluate your motive for being
   attractive. However, if it is to draw attention to yourself, maybe it
   is time to re-orient yourself about real beauty.

5. You do not like associating with the “ordinary” or unpopular.

   Whenever you go to an event, which kind of people do you usually want
   to sit with? Do you immediately look for the table where the “elite”
   sit around? If you think you only deserve professionals and
   “first-class” citizens for your friends and avoid hanging out with
   “low-level” people, then you are clearly prideful.

   To get rid of this attitude, be equal in treating people. Make friends
   not according to social status, but the sincerity of individuals
   towards you. Associating with people who do not have any title attached
   to their names will not make you cheap.

6. You are fond of name-dropping.

   If you have the habit of talking about your connections with
   influential, rich, or powerful personalities, then you are certainly
   proud. Bragging about being connected with such people makes you feel
   entitled to yourself.

   The people you talk with are probably annoyed listening about your
   “connections” already. If you admit you struggle with this, be more
   conscious of controlling yourself from talking much.

7. You are not teachable.

   Not listening to someone who is trying to teach you something is
   another sign of pride. It is either you think you know things already,
   or you think you know more than the person. It could also mean you
   consider him/her inferior to you.

   Having a teachable heart is one trait of humility. Whether you seem
   more knowledgeable than the person trying to teach you or you actually
   know about the “lesson” already, make sure that you show respect by
   listening attentively and not trying to cut him/her off.

8. You do not listen to others’ advice.

   Prideful people are also stubborn. They think they know everything
   already, so they disregard the counsel of others. You are one of them
   if you brush off the advice of your parents, some elders, or anyone
   else.

   Renew your character by starting to listen to your parents or the
   mature people surrounding you. Even if you disagree with what they say,
   give time to weigh your decision against their words of wisdom.

9. You do not like to be surpassed by anyone.

   Considering others as threats to your position, fame, and success is a
   result of pride. Your achievements could have gotten into your head
   already that you think you should always be the no. 1. Thus, when you
   meet people who have the potential to beat your accomplishments, you
   consider them as rivals.

   Competition is only healthy if you compete with your past self. So
   instead of focusing on being ahead of others, why not focus on
   improving yourself?

10. You think you are too important to do mundane things.

   If you think your position is so high that you cannot pick up trash,
   help clean up, or serve others, that is definitely pride.

   Do not let entitlement make you feel like you are more important than
   anyone else. Great people are not afraid to serve those who are less
   fortunate than them.

11. You are critical to those who do better than you.

   One symptom of pride that you should watch out for is being critical
   towards others, especially those you are insecure with. Pointing out
   their flaws makes you feel better about yourself and better than them.

   Bitterness is the result of pride stepped on. Whenever you feel
   resentment towards someone who did better than you, keep yourself from
   thinking or saying bad comments about the person. Instead, give
   appreciation and be happy for him/her.

Healthy Pride is Good

   Not all pride is bad. It can be good.

   Good pride is a healthy, positive attitude towards ourselves and our
   lives. It does not mean thinking we are better than others or that we
   should be treated differently.

1. Self-confidence is a good pride

   We should be confident, not arrogant. Confident people are realistic.
   They know what they can do well and try to do it often, but they also
   recognize what they cannot do and try to avoid those things.

2. Self-respect is a healthy pride

   This is the most important aspect of healthy pride. We should respect
   ourselves by respecting others. Treating others well helps us feel
   better about ourselves, while ignoring or mistreating others makes us
   feel worse.

3. A positive outlook on life

   If we believe our lives will be better in the future, we are more
   likely to make it so. Unfortunately, some people get stuck in their
   past and cannot see their lives getting any better. They have a
   negative outlook on life and feel trapped. This can be changed with
   some effort.

4. self-esteem

   We all have things we are good at and enjoy doing. However, we also
   have bad habits or skills that we can improve. Self-esteem includes
   recognizing both of these sides to ourselves.

   Healthy pride comes from within: we should be proud of what we
   accomplish without feeling that we deserve special treatment. Healthy
   pride comes from God: when he made us in his image, he gave us value
   and worth; he expects nothing less than excellence from us as well!

5. Optimism

   Optimists believe that good things will happen in their lives if they
   work hard for them. Therefore, we tend to be more optimistic when
   working towards something worthwhile rather than just trying to get
   through the day without too much trouble.

   Achieving goals helps us feel more positive about ourselves and feel
   motivated to set new goals because of this success.

6. Those with healthy pride lead, motivate, and inspire others.

   They do not use their success as a way to put others down. On the
   contrary, they want the good of everyone to be achieved and are willing
   to support the efforts of others towards this end.

   These people are committed, involved citizens and positive contributors
   in all aspects of society.

   They know what they are capable of, what they can achieve, so they try
   it. Others see this effort and self-confidence and want to be part of
   it, inspiring others to succeed in whatever way possible.

7. Being able to take care of yourself.

   Healthy pride means taking care of yourself and being grateful for the
   opportunities you have been given in life. For instance: being thankful
   for your family, education, job, etc. Having healthy pride means that
   you do not need to compare yourself with others – you are enough on
   your own!

   People with healthy pride can see their own flaws and weaknesses. They
   also have the ability to assess the value of others even more than
   themselves because they have a more realistic view of life.

   Because of this, they can make focused efforts to help themselves,
   improve themselves as well as helping others achieve their goals.


   This positive attitude allows us the freedom to pursue goals rather
   than just surviving or getting by on a day-to-day basis. In return, we
   may find happiness instead of sorrow when pursuing our ambitions!

What are the characteristics of an prideful person?

1) Being unthankful.

   Proud people are always asking for more than they have been given.
   Unfortunately, they consider whatever they receive as little and not
   enough, so they are never satisfied or contented with what they have.

   They think they deserve everything good that happens to them. When they
   get something, they regard it as a right, not a gift from others. As a
   result, they don’t appreciate what others do for them.

   When people are grateful, they appreciate and acknowledge what others
   do for them. Proud people overlook gratitude or do not have the
   attitude of appreciation. They don’t think about their family members
   as those who care and try to help them; instead, they only think about
   themselves.

   Their thankfulness is for themselves.

2) Being arrogant.

   Proud people put themselves above others and treat them with arrogance,
   disdain, contempt, and condescension.

   A proud person will speak to his spouse as if she were a servant or
   child rather than an adult equal in marriage. Likewise, he will talk
   down to subordinates at work as if they had no value except what he
   assigns.

   He gives orders and then treats them like dirt when they obey him—and
   maybe even when they fail to obey him for reasons beyond their control!

3) Being selfish.

   Prideful people think only of themselves and their own needs first, not
   about the needs of others around them who may be suffering. They often
   take advantage of others.

   They are not willing to help people who need it, even when they can do
   so easily.

4) Being defensive.

   A prideful person doesn’t like to admit that he has faults or
   weaknesses. He is defensive when anyone points them out, so he does not
   improve himself and correct his mistakes. Instead, he often blames
   others for the things that are going wrong with him.

   He may even blame other people’s success on their connections or luck
   instead of giving them credit for working hard and being intelligent.
   They make up excuses for why they needn’t change themselves even if
   they have problems in life.

   When someone doubts a great idea that the proud one has, he feels
   challenged in his superiority over others and becomes very
   argumentative in defending his opinion. Thus, he is certain of himself
   when he argues that only bad ideas come from stupid and inferior people
   like everyone else besides him!

5) Refusing to forgive others.

   Prideful people think that any injustice against them must be punished
   severely to feel better about themselves and especially to inflict pain
   on those who hurt them (even if they were the only one who was hurt).

   They focus on their own rights and think they are entitled to get back
   what others have done, or even more.

   Prideful people aren’t willing to forgive others who offend them, no
   matter how repentant they are or how much it would be for the good of
   their relationships if they did so.

6) Overreacting emotionally.

   When proud people experience something unpleasant, especially when
   someone mistreats them, they often overreact emotionally by acting out
   anger.

   They may yell at those around them without thinking about whether or
   not it is appropriate (like in front of children, you should not teach
   bad behavior). Or else the offended person withdraws into his shell and
   becomes distant, cold, and prickly.

7) Expressing prejudice.

   A proud person stops people from relating to him by being prejudiced
   and judgmental against them.

   He refuses to have friends who are not like him—in his race or religion
   or politics or other things he cares about above all. If someone is
   different (especially if they are inferior somehow), he will turn
   against that person rather than seek any good from their differences.

8) Jealous.

   Prideful people are envious of others and want to tear them down
   because those people have something good that proud people don’t get
   for themselves.

   When someone does something right, a prideful person thinks it is bad
   because it makes him look bad for not doing as well himself. So he gets
   upset at the success of others and tries to make them feel guilty for
   shaming him.

   Likewise, a prideful person feels bitter when someone gets a gift or
   good fortune that he did not receive. He is jealous of what others have
   or do and does not rejoice for them.

   They look at others with resentment when they are happy or doing well
   somehow—especially by having a better spouse or better kids or more
   money or a better job than the proud person himself has.

9) Bullying.

   Prideful people don’t like it when they feel small, so they will bully
   others into making themselves feel bigger. They are overbearing and
   tyrannical with those who don’t think or act as they do to maintain
   their ego.

   They are domineering and controlling with those around them who need
   guidance and training rather than bullying statements or commands to
   obey blindly without question.

10) Having an attitude of superiority.

   A proud person believes that he is superior to others in some way and
   thus looks down on them with scorn or contempt or something worse. He
   may not express this directly, but it will likely eventually come out
   in abusive words or deeds if this view lurks under the surface.

   Some people are proud of their money, success, social status,
   intelligence, physical characteristics such as strength or beauty
   (especially when they do not deserve these advantages), etc. These
   things can make a person feel superior and treat those who have less
   poorly to make himself feel better about himself.

Why is pride so sinful?

   There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you have achieved. For
   example, a good parent is proud of their child when they do well in
   school or win a sports competition. Likewise, you may be very proud of
   your car, house, or job, and rightly so – they are all achievements
   that deserve to be praised.

   But pride can become a sin when it turns into arrogance.

   The Apostle Paul, who wrote most of the New Testament, was an
   incredible man. He helped change the world with his writing and
   preaching and even had churches planted in some of the most difficult
   places like Corinth and Rome.

   Yet he writes to Timothy, ‘I have fought the good fight, I have
   finished the race, and I have remained faithful.’ (2 Timothy 4:7) –
   this is a humble statement from someone who has done so much for God’s
   kingdom.

   Pride causes us to think that we are better than others or that what we
   do is more important than others. It makes us believe that our
   achievements are entirely our own doing rather than recognizing the
   hand of God along the way. Pride stops us from thanking Him for His
   grace.

   When we are proud of our achievements, it becomes difficult to accept
   criticism or negative feedback because we don’t think we need any help.

   Pride stops us from serving others. When someone is arrogant, they
   think they are better than everyone else – so why serve others? They
   will look down on you for doing menial tasks, whereas if you were
   humble, you would serve others and do menial tasks out of obedience.

   Pride can indeed be a sin when we are proud of our achievements, but it
   can also be a sin when we are proud about who we are rather than what
   we do.

   It’s okay to say ‘I am good at mathematics’ or ‘I am an amazing
   singer,’ but if this becomes more important to us than saying, ‘Jesus
   sacrificed His life for me, and I have come to love Him deeply,’ then
   pride has set in.

   Pride stops us from being thankful for the incredible grace that God
   has given us. When someone is arrogant, they think nothing of thanking
   Jesus for anything – because they consider themselves so great! But if
   you were truly humble, you would be thankful for every blessing that
   comes your way, whether it be something as small as a cup of water or
   something great like the life of Jesus.

What do the Bible verses say about pride?

     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption, and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


     Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
     Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share
     plunder with the proud. (Proverbs 16:18-19, NIV)


     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


     And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes
     the proud but gives grace to the humble.” (James 4:6, NLT)


     do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is
     not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then
     you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted
     in.” That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief,
     but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.
     (Romans 11:18-20, ESV)


     One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will
     obtain honor. (Proverbs 29:23, ESV)


     When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
     wisdom. (Proverbs 11:2, NIV)


     The LORD detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will
     not go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5, NIV)


     Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the
     company of ordinary people. And don’t think you know it all! (Romans
     12:16, NLT)


     Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those
     who take advice. (Proverbs 13:10, NIV)


     Let someone else praise you, not your own mouth— a stranger, not
     your own lips. (Proverbs 27:2, NLT)


     Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin. (Proverbs
     21:4, NLT)


     Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.
     (James 4:10, NLT)



Evaluate Your Heart

   Many other things could give you a hint that pride is attacking you.
   The bottom line here is your motivation. If you do things out of
   selfish ambitions, then you are definitely prideful.

   To prevent pride from overcoming you, you must check your motives
   daily. It is important that you keep your feet on the ground, no matter
   how high you have reached already.

   God knows your heart, and if it is full of pride, He might teach you
   some lessons. Remember, the Bible says in Luke 14:11, “For all those
   who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
   will be exalted.”

   Thank you for truth. The Lord woke me up out of my sleep in regards to
   my behavior. I never knew I was operating in pride until the Lord
   showed me a reflection of myself . I had to repent and believe I will
   continue to do so in this area until Yah’s will be done in my life.

   came across this page and the truth shall set me free . Halleluyah
   sanctify us by your truth
   Today yah for his grace and mercy .

   How do you answer or respond like this? No offense, I just wondered bc
   Id like it if I could do the same – use the right /proper amount of
   words and or explainations instead of doing what I usually do – talk
   too much or long and respond with long , very detailed (like I am right
   now!!) and it may even seem unnecessary to the one’s who receive and or
   read it.

   Hello Sarah Miller, my name is Jacob Miller. And I just have to say
   that upon reading your comment here, I can’t help but instantly see
   myself in you (as so much that everything you wrote I too am very
   guilty of doing &amp; have always wished I can do better &amp; change or make
   an bigger effort in trying to stop doing. B/c everyone I’m talking to
   or attempting to share with either get bored and/or very impatient &amp;
   begin urging me to try to speed it up &amp; get to the point a bit faster.
   LMAO! I was just very taken aback at coming across a female version of
   myself in the comments here. AND even more so, is the fact that we ALSO
   share the same last name too! Very cute! Anyhoo, I wish you to have a
   very warming, loving, &amp; fantastic rest of your 2021 year! 💯😇🤝👍🏻😉🤗

   My boy friend has all these qualities mentioned above. Yet he prides
   himself as being quiet, gentle and humble. Any time I point out his
   flaws becomes defensive and says that use my perception of him and it’s
   irrelevant. I’m really tired of his attitudes

   Sometimes a person can be proud of not being proud. hehehehe Many don’t
   realize they have it.
   There are several types of pride.
   And bad pride is sin. According to the Scriptures;” Pride goeth before
   destructions.. … Self-pity, self-condemnation self-exaltation, etc; ard
   members of being prideful.:)

   I see your point now but have not been able to see it this way in the
   past. Usually we only see or hear pride described as being too self
   absorbed, character traits that reflects too much like/love for self
   and whatever self wants , not the other way around. I never saw myself
   as prideful for feeling less than . I didn’t understand pride could
   mean not listening and or giving attention /time to other’s advice /
   suggestions. (proper/fair, which includes even when we do not agree
   with them or what they’re telling us. It might not be that other’s are
   ignoring you or deliberately putting you off, try to remember that
   we’re all in different places whether it’s Spiritually, mentally,
   emotionally, and or even physically- so, it very well might be that
   they are lacking knowledge, wisdom, intelligence, Spiritual fitness and
   or even no Spiritual guide / knowledge at all. Also , they may lack
   self awareness which definitely hinders us and leads to behavior that
   hurts others – but not necessarily on purpose. I know now that I’m
   guilty of this kind of stuff but my behavior/actions/words like this
   come from outside influences / sins of other’s. Maybe we were raised
   differently than they (person we consider prideful) were so whats good
   behavior as far as we’re concerned and or proper Godly actions /choices
   may not be familiar or even “Godly ” or proper to them at all. Usually
   followers of Christ have The Holy Spirit to guide them, direct them,
   teach them what’s good and truth versus what’s bad evil and lies . It’s
   helpful to keep in mind that we all mature Spiritually and emotionally
   at different places. I know I’m not as wise as some of the (most of
   the) other church fellowshippers / brother’s and sister’s in Christ
   are. I can focus on God and His Love for me (unconditional) and look to
   Him and only Him for answers to final decisions about life , love, and
   all things in between. ( We can all look to God for help with our
   emotional issues, our questions and fears pertaining to our mental
   health – help understanding better and or how God expects , wants/would
   like us to live with it . I feel like God is telling me to end my
   response here. I hope and pray you and other’s find it helpful in some
   way- I know God loves you and everyone else who reads this regardless
   of the reason any of you are here -taking interest, just happened upon
   it while searching – I have done this before and I like to believe God
   does it for His purposes , please believe that it isn’t just a
   coincidence or chance happening. Remember , you are not alone and
   Loneliness can confuse. We could be allowing untruths and or our lack
   of Godly wisdom and trust in God to bring negative thoughts about this
   into our minds . I used to see alone and or loneliness as very negative
   and bad and not welcome in my life at all ( if I could help it ). I
   felt or thought these negative things bc I saw or perceived it wrongly
   even thought about it in wrong ways that became irrational. God is
   teaching me the truth about it . His Word – the Bible is where we will
   learn – the old past way of seeing, thinking, and or believing will be
   erased and new ways , Godly ways , will take their place . An easier
   way to say that is like this- lies will be replaced with the truth.
   Only God can bring the understanding and make it real to your heart .
   He starts by bringing our mind and heart together ( one of the first
   things God does to help us) .

38 Signs Of Pride In A Person

   Too much pride will cause problems in your relationships, jobs,
   friendships, and ultimately every area of your life. Unfortunately,
   pride makes it hard to grow because the pain inside causes information
   to be filtered wrong and in a way that it doesn’t hurt the ego. Often a
   prideful person doesn’t know how severe their pride is.

   The pride within the person is there to protect their VERY fragile ego.
   For instance, if you point out flawed behavior in a prideful person
   they won’t be able to accept it OR won’t be able to see the truth.
   Especially if that behavior is very embarrassing for them. The fragile
   ego of others will push them to use different types of unhealthy coping
   mechanism to deflect painful comments and experiences. The unhealthy
   coping mechanism can be laughing off your comment, denial, blaming you,
   downplaying their own actions, be offended you accused them, and many
   other unhealthy coping mechanisms.

   Unfortunately, many that struggle with pride lack support because
   “pride” and “ego” stop them from asking for help. Or they don’t have
   the right type of support because the pride causes one to avoid/refuse
   to take constructive criticism from anyone. And a prideful person may
   feel afraid of vulnerability or be unwilling to feel inferior to the
   person giving the help.

What causes pride?

   The ultimate cause of pride is trying to fix our low self-esteem,
   unworthiness, and fears in our own strength. Pride damages your career
   and relationships because you are only pretending to be confident,
   strong, and bold.
     * 7 Root Causes of Pride + tips to be more humble:
          + #1 Trying to fix everything.
          + #2 Fear of humility.
          + #3 Fear of Vulnerability.
          + #5 Low self-esteem.
          + #6 Impossible standards of perfection.
          + #7 Thinking you are not all-knowing.

   annoys me.

   37. When someone is sharing their feelings or perspective, I interrupt
   them to correct facts.

   38. If someone doesn’t understand what I’m saying I feel impatient and
   I think they’re dumb or slow.

       I am thankful to have came across these insightful words. I never
       knew all the things that were added into being prideful and now
       thanks to GOD putting a scripture into my Bible reading this
       morning which was right on time I then started researching what are
       prideful ways and I came across your insights thank you so much
       ????????????✨

            You’re most welcome! I’m grateful to hear that you found the
            insights helpful and timely. It’s wonderful that God’s Word
            led you to discover more about prideful ways and provided you
            with the information you needed. Remember, seeking wisdom and
            understanding is a continuous journey, and I’m glad I could
            play a small part in assisting you on that path. May your
            continued Bible reading and research deepen your spiritual
            knowledge and draw you closer to God’s truth. God bless you
            abundantly! xoxo Christina

The Curse of Arrogance and Pride: An Islamic Perspective on Overcoming
Division

   Arrogance and pride

   In our social and cultural setups, the curse of arrogance and pride has
   infiltrated our hearts, fueling division and discord among individuals
   and communities. This destructive mindset hinders personal growth,
   erodes relationships, and tears at the fabric of society. However,
   Islamic teachings offer a transformative path towards overcoming these
   negative traits, fostering unity, and nurturing a harmonious
   coexistence.

   Arrogance and pride breed a sense of superiority, blinding individuals
   to the inherent worth and dignity of others. In our pursuit of worldly
   accomplishments, we often forget that true success lies in recognizing
   the greatness of the Creator and our own limitations as human beings.
   Islamic teachings remind us that Allah does not favor those who are
   arrogant or boastful, as arrogance stems from a false sense of
   self-importance and denies the equality and interdependence of all
   human beings.

   The curse of arrogance and pride manifests in various forms within our
   social and cultural setups. It manifests as elitism, where individuals
   perceive themselves as superior based on wealth, social status, or
   lineage. It fuels tribalism and racism, creating divisions based on
   ethnicity, race, or nationality. It fuels religious intolerance,
   leading to sectarianism and the marginalization of others based on
   differing beliefs.

Overcome the curse of arrogance and pride

   To overcome the curse of arrogance and pride, Islamic teachings offer a
   profound solution rooted in humbleness and humility. Muslims are
   encouraged to cultivate a deep sense of self-awareness, acknowledging
   that all blessings and abilities come from Allah. Instead of boasting
   about worldly accomplishments, believers are taught to express
   gratitude to the Creator and recognize the contributions and worth of
   others.

   Islamic teachings promote the concept of “taqwa,” which is
   God-consciousness or mindfulness of Allah in all aspects of life. Taqwa
   serves as a safeguard against arrogance, reminding believers that they
   are accountable to a higher power and responsible for their actions and
   treatment of others. It encourages individuals to humble themselves
   before Allah, seeking His forgiveness, guidance, and mercy.
   Furthermore, the practice of “Sunnah,” the teachings and actions of the
   Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), provides a practical roadmap for
   embodying humbleness and humility.

   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known for his modesty,
   simplicity, and compassion towards all people, regardless of their
   social status or beliefs. His life serves as a shining example of the
   transformative power of humility in building bridges and nurturing
   harmonious relationships. In the light of Islamic teachings, the
   solution to overcoming the curse of arrogance and pride lies in a
   collective effort to return to the core values of Islam. It requires
   individuals to introspect, purify their hearts, and develop a genuine
   sense of humility. By recognizing the worth and value of every
   individual, regardless of their background or beliefs, Muslims can
   foster a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity.

   Islamic teachings call upon believers to engage in acts of kindness,
   charity, and service to humanity, seeking to uplift others rather than
   seeking personal gain or recognition. By putting the needs of others
   before their own and embracing the spirit of selflessness, Muslims can
   actively contribute to the betterment of society and counter the
   divisive effects of arrogance and pride.

   In conclusion, the curse of arrogance and pride poses a significant
   threat to our social and cultural setups. Islamic teachings offer a
   transformative solution rooted in humbleness and humility. By
   cultivating self-awareness, practicing gratitude, adhering to taqwa,
   and following the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him),
   Muslims can overcome the negative impacts of arrogance and pride. By
   embodying the values of Islam, we can nurture a society that promotes
   unity, respect, and compassion, paving the way for a harmonious
   coexistence and a brighter future for all.

Characteristics of the Islamic Moral Code

   The main objective of the Islamic moral code is to create an “Islamic

Why is Pride Such a Big Sin in Islam?

   15 September, 2020
   Q Assalamu alaikum, may Allah's blessings be upon you.My question is
   regarding the idea of pride. I understand that it does not lie in
   honesty and decency for one to have the intention to show off in front
   of another while performing an action, as in this case, it equates to
   the action not being done at all, due to insincerity and impurity of
   one's intention.Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) too stressed on how indecent it
   is to have showing off one's own ability as the motive behind an
   action, by classifying it as the most dangerous minor shirk.I strongly
   believe in Allah's commands and have no doubt that it is wrong to have
   such intentions.But I would like to know, just to understand this whole
   thing better, why does one attach such ideas and intentions to actions
   that are meant to help us find our own truth? In short, I would like to
   know more about why pride (that leads one to show off) is so sinful and
   wrong , even if it's only a small feeling of it.

Answer

   Short Answer:
     * When pride finds its way into the hearts of Muslims, it quickly
       affects the way we talk, act and treat others. This is why it
       should be avoided and we should stay away from it just like any
       other sin.
     * The most severe sin is being arrogant against Allah Almighty by
       rejecting submission and worshipping Him.

   Thank you for your question,

Why is Pride Such a Big Sin in Islam?

   Prophet Muhammad said,

     “One will not enter Paradise if one has an atom’s weight of
     arrogance in his/her heart.” (Tirmidhi)

   All human beings have the tendency to become proud but there are
   different degrees of pride. It could be so little that it becomes
   unnoticeable and yet it could grow to be eventually a larger amount.
   That is why we always pray to Allah not to make us among the proud and
   arrogant people.

   Ads by Muslim Ad Network

   Pride brings confusion in the religion of Allah and thus it corrupts
   the heart and prevents it from thinking about over the verses of the
   Quran.

How salah (prayers) curbs pride

   As Muslims, Allah commanded us not to bow before anyone but him. That
   is why performing Salah is very important in Islam because Prophet
   Muhammad said it is the only thing that separates Muslims from the
   unbelievers.

   During Salah, everyone lines around each no matter which position they
   hold in society.  Prostrating during Salah shows how humble a Muslim
   can be because the closest way Allah can be to his servants is when the
   servants prostrate to him. As Muslims, Allah commanded us not to bow
   before anyone but Him.

   Islam teaches us to be humble to one another. One of the
   characteristics of a good Muslim is humbleness and humility, pride is a
   characteristic of Satan. Pride could make people disobedient towards
   the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

The negative effects of pride

   It is only pride that will make a Muslim not forgive another Muslim,
   when their forgiveness is being asked. Hence, a proud person will start
   thinking that he or she is better than others, forgetting that we were
   all created from clay and we have a grave to go to and Allah to answer
   to.

   Pride causes people not to be content and they are eternally in pursuit
   of power and position. Pride pushes people away from the religion of
   Allah and the curse of Allah is on the proud and arrogant.

     “I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You
     created from clay.”

   Allah Almighty said in Noble Quran about the greatest sin arrogance
   (pride) in these words:

     “[To them] it will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell to abide
     eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant”
     (Quran, 39:72).

   According to the Holy Quran, arrogance (pride) is the sin that will be
   severely punished by Allah Almighty. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad said
   that pride is the disease which is the greatest sin in the sight of
   Allah Almighty; one who is proud is arrogant. People who are arrogant
   will not enter paradise.

   People who live in a state of pride and betrayal reside in a dark
   internal world full of a extreme fear of losing, making a mistake,
   being humiliated, stress, doubt, hatred, anger, and passion.

   Arrogant people’s behavior is always expected to make them appear more
   valuable and superior in the eyes of other people. In other words, they
   feel superior from others.

   Allah Almighty turns the arrogant people away from being guided with
   His signs. For those people Allah Almighty says in Holy Quran:

     “I will turn away from My Ayahs (verses of the Quran) those who
     behave arrogantly on the earth, without a right, and (even) if they
     see all the Ayahs (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons signs,
     revelations, etc.), they will not believe in them…” (Quran; 7:146)

The sin of being arrogant against Allah

   The most severe sin is being arrogant against Allah Almighty by
   rejecting submission and worshipping Him. Allah Almighty says about
   these arrogant people in Holy Quran,

     “Verily! Those who stray from my worship (because of arrogance),
     they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!” (Quran, 40:60).

   The person who is arrogant or proud likes that people should stand up
   for him, whether on his coming or while he is sitting. Nor likes that
   anyone should sit or walk beside him.

   Arrogant people live in a constant state of discomfort due to which
   they never find peace in life. Like sea salt water, the thirst is never
   quenched with it.

   When pride finds its way into the hearts of Muslims, it quickly affects
   the way we talk, act and treat others. This is why it should be avoided
   and we should stay away from it just like any other sin.

   May Allah save us from this dangerous disease of the heart. Aameen.

   And Allah knows best.

   I hope this helps.

   Salam and please keep in touch.

     Ellen [DeGeneres] jump into the fire to make them change. And if I
     hadn’t seen her on TV, I would have thought, ‘I could never be on
     TV. They don’t let LGBT people on TV.’ And more than that, I would
     have gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn’t
     even have a right to be here.”

     whiteness, gender, sexual preferences, etc. Only then can we have a

     within.”

     daughter for a few minutes while she runs out to the post office.
     It’s the chasm between being invited to a colleague’s wedding with
     your same-sex partner and being able to slow-dance without the other
     guests whispering.”

     31. “If public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids
     who saw them on TV would feel safe before they even knew why they
     felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay
     kids would never feel dangerous. Maybe we could have a world where
     we could all just live. We may not all agree, but why can’t we just
     all live?”

     34. “Love demands expression. It will not stay still, stay silent,

     the liquid.”

   – Jeanette Winterson

     35. “Each step forwards to become the person we are makes it harder
     to go backwards, to return to the shadowy, private world of closed
     doors and shuttered windows. The experience, the awakening of one’s
     true self, after being so long suppressed, can never be adequately
     explained with language.”

Frequently Asked Questions About Pride Month

   Pride Month FAQ Pride Month FAQ

What is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is a time for the LGBT community and allies to come
   together in celebration, solidarity, activism, reflection, and support
   of all LGBTQIA+ people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
   intersex, and asexual).

   While a Pride Parade or Pride March are often part of Pride
   celebrations, there’s more to this holiday than parades! Pride can be a
   meaningful time to learn about the historical and present struggles and
   exclusion of LGBT people.

When is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is celebrated during the month of June. In 2023, Pride
   Month will be June 1-30, 2023.

Where is Pride Month celebrated?

   Pride Month is primarily celebrated in the United States. However, you
   can find Pride Month festivities around the globe – even in areas where
   it is not an officially recognized occasion.

How did Pride begin?

   Pride originated as a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the
   Stonewall Uprising (sometimes called the Stonewall Riots). In the early
   hours of June 28, 1969, police conducted a raid on a gay bar called the
   Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City.

   Unfortunately, during this time, being gay was a criminal offense. In
   fact, it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person until 1966. Raids
   on gay bars were standard procedure, but this raid would go down in
   history as the birth of the Pride movement.

   Led by courageous transwomen, people at the Stonewall Inn protested the
   raid, leading to a six-day-long resistance. By just the second evening,
   thousands of protestors had gathered. Confrontation, violence, and
   escalation ensued for nearly a week. In the aftermath of Stonewall,
   many people became more engaged in activism and advocating for the
   equal treatment for LGBT people.

   The first Pride march was held one year later, on June 28, 1970.

Is It Permissible to Have Pride? Is There Such Thing as Good Pride?

   [June 28, 2022] [Shaykh Yusuf Weltch]/in Adab, Living Religion,
   Spirituality
     __________________________________________________________________

   Answered by Shaykh Yusuf Weltch

Question

   What can we have pride in? Is there a good pride? I heard that we can
   have pride in battle as that gives us more strength or the feeling of
   strength, but my question is, does this mean any battle?

   If I was playing in a sports match could I have pride in myself? Also,
   is there a good type of pride?

Answer

   In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful and Compassionate

   Your question is another reflection of the difficulty and the downside
   of translation from Arabic to English. There are many words in the
   Arabic language that translate into words of similar meaning in
   English. One example of this is the words translated as pride.

   The word Kibr (translated as pride or arrogance) has a very bad
   connotation, whereas, the word Fakhr (translated as pride, also) can
   have a good connotation. Let’s define each as they are understood in
   the Arabic language.

Kibr

   Kibr (pride or arrogance) comes from the word Kabir, meaning to be
   great. Thus this word means the state of a person who deems themselves
   great in comparison to others. This is always a blameworthy
   characteristic for all created beings; this is because only Allah Most
   High is absolutely great: hence the saying Allahu Akbar. [Ghazali, Ihya
   ‘Ulum al-Din]

   To act out one’s pride (kibr), either inwardly or outwardly, is sinful.

Inward Manifestations of Pride

   The inward manifestation of pride is explained in the following
   Prophetic narration:

   The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and give him peace) said,
   “No one who has an atom’s weight of pride (kibr) in their heart will
   enter Paradise.” A man (amongst the Companions) said, “Surely a person
   loves that his clothes look good and that his shoes look good.” The
   Messenger replied, “Indeed, Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride
   (kibr) is to refuse to accept the truth and to look down on people.”
   [Muslim]

Outward Manifestations of Pride

   The outward manifestations of pride are many. Here are some of them:
     * Walking haughtily
     * Allowing their garments to drag on the floor, to show their status
     * Speaking harshly to people
     * Being upset when one is advised by others
     * Physical or emotional abuse of people
     * Backbiting [Ibid.]

   All of the above are prohibited in the Sacred Law. The only exception
   to some of the above is in the context of standing up against
   arrogant/oppressive people. The Great Yahya bin Muadh (Allah be pleased
   with him) said, “Showing pride in the face of a prideful person is
   humility.” i.e. it is warranted in some situations if done with the
   right intention.

   One of the situations that warrant this behavior is in battle. There
   are many examples of this in the various historical battles of Islam,
   in which the Believers are defending their lives, their freedom to
   worship Allah Most High alone, and the safety of the society. In such a
   situation, harshness is warranted.

   Even though a soccer match or a sports game may be competitive, it is
   not befitting for a Believer to be harsh, haughty, or act unjustly
   toward their opponents. Rather, the Believer, while striving to win,
   should uphold the greatest of character and dignity.

   Hope this helps
   Allah knows best

25 Important Examples of Pride in the Bible

   Mar 5, 2022Mar 8, 2022 by Editor in Chief

   According to the Bible, pride is when you think too highly of yourself.
   Sinful pride usually involves you thinking and acting in a way that
   shows you think you are better than God and/or the people around you.

   Since not all pride is sin, let’s look at 25 important examples of
   pride in the Bible to learn exactly what sinful pride is so we can
   examine our own pride in our lives.

1. Jesus is Beat and Mocked by the Guards

   “Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s
   headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And
   they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and twisting together
   a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right
   hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, ‘Hail, King of
   the Jews!’ And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the
   head.” (Matthew 27:27-30 ESV)

   C.S. Lewis said, “the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride.” We
   see pride, the utmost evil, in action as the guards take the King of
   the Universe, Jesus Christ, and treat Him as if He were no better than
   dirt. They beat and mock Jesus before sending Him to the cross,
   treating Jesus as though He were inferior to them.

2. Naaman’s Refusal to Get into the Water

   “And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, ‘Go and wash in the Jordan
   seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.’
   But Naaman was angry and went away, saying, ‘Behold, I thought that he
   would surely come out to me and stand and call upon the name of the
   Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.'”
   (2nd Kings 5:10-11 ESV)

   Naaman had a severe disease called leprosy, which would eventually kill
   him if nothing was done about it. Elisha told Naaman that God would
   heal him if Naaman would go wash in the Jordan River, which was a very
   gross body of water. Naaman was too proud of a man to do so, but
   eventually, he changed his mind and was healed.

3. Simon the Magician Tries to Buy the Holy Spirit

   “Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of
   the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying, ‘Give me this power
   also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy
   Spirit.'” (Acts 8:18-19 ESV)

   Simon saw the Holy Spirit work through the Apostles, and he wanted the
   same gift. In an ultimate act of pride, Simon tried to buy the gift of
   the Holy Spirit with money. He tried to take a gift that came from
   God’s grace and buy it for his prideful pleasure.

4. The Pride in All of Our Hearts

   “Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity,
   to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they
   exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the
   creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.”
   (Romans 1:24-25 ESV)

   There are points in all of our lives where we sin by doing what God
   does not want us to do.  We choose to use the good things that God has
   given us for selfish pleasure. We are being prideful people by doing
   what we want instead of what the Creator has called us to do.

5. Adam and Eve Eat the Forbidden Fruit

   “So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
   a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one
   wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her
   husband who was with her, and he ate.” (Genesis 3:6 ESV)

   When God made the universe, He gave the first humans, Adam and Eve, one
   rule. That was not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
   and evil. Due to their pride, they thought they knew more than God and
   ate the fruit anyway.

6. Saul Persecutes the Church

   “And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in
   Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea
   and Samaria, except the apostles. Devout men buried Stephen and made
   great lamentation over him. But Saul was ravaging the church, and
   entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed
   them to prison.” (Acts 8:1-3 ESV)

   Saul, who would later become the apostle Paul, who wrote most of the
   New Testament, persecuted the early church. Before Saul met Jesus, he
   was a prideful person who thought he was better than the Jewish
   Christians. Saul thought he had the right to beat, imprison, and kill
   them.

7. Goliath Judgment of David

   “And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his
   shield-bearer in front of him. And when the Philistine looked and saw
   David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in
   appearance.” (1 Samuel 17:41-42 ESV)

   The Philistine, who is Goliath, looks at the young man David and thinks
   David is not a worthy opponent to fight. Goliath’s sinful pride only
   allows him to look at the outside of David, not his heart. It is a good
   thing that God judges our hearts and not by our physical appearances.

8. The Golden Statue of Nebuchadnezzar

   “King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty
   cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura,
   in the province of Babylon. And the herald proclaimed aloud, ‘You are
   commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, that when you hear the
   sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of
   music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King
   Nebuchadnezzar has set up.'” (Daniel 3:1&amp;4-5 ESV)

   In the book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar makes a giant gold statue of
   himself and forces everyone to bow to it. The sin of pride is seen here
   by Nebuchadnezzar making much of himself instead of God. Later in the
   book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar’s pride leads to him having a very hard
   time in his life.

9. The Pharisee Judges the Sinner Woman

   “One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the
   Pharisee’s house and reclined at table. And behold, a woman of the
   city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table
   in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and
   standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet
   with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his
   feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had
   invited him saw this, he said to himself, ‘If this man were a prophet,
   he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching
   him, for she is a sinner.'” (Luke 7:36-39 ESV)

   The sinner woman, who was probably a prostitute, cleans Jesus’ feet and
   puts a lovely smelling perfume on Him. The Pharisee, instead of seeing
   a woman who needs the love of Christ Jesus, judges her and sees a woman
   who he thinks is the scum of society (as someone fulfilling mens’ lust
   of the flesh). This prideful person judges the woman because he views
   himself as better than her.

10. The Pride of the Haughty Spirit

   “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”
   (Proverbs 16:18 ESV)

   The book of Proverbs is full of teaching on pride. “Haughty” means that
   you think you are superior or that you have an exalted sense of
   yourself. People who have a haughty spirit are full of pride because
   they believe they are better than those around them.

11. Opposition of the Proud

   “But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, ‘God opposes the proud but
   gives grace to the humble.'” (James 4:6 ESV)

   There is such a thing as good pride in the Bible. However, most of the
   time that pride is mentioned in Scripture, it is something we want to
   oppose. Often, people whose life is marked by this pride do not
   understand their need for grace or humility.

12. Judas Sells Jesus for 30 Pieces of Silver

   “Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the
   chief priests and said, ‘What will you give me if I deliver him over to
   you?’ And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment
   he sought an opportunity to betray him.” (Matthew 26:14-17 ESV)

   Even though Judas traveled with Jesus for three years, hearing Him
   teach God’s word, he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. In a prideful
   moment of defiance, Judas thought he was better than Jesus and was
   willing to trade Jesus to those that wanted to kill Him.

13. The Pharisee Who Thinks He Is Better than a Tax Collector

   “He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they
   were righteous, and treated others with contempt: ‘Two men went up into
   the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The
   Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am
   not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this
   tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’
   But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his
   eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a
   sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather
   than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but
   the one who humbles himself will be exalted.'” (Luke 18:9-14 ESV)

   Pride can be seen in the Pharisee because he thinks he is better than
   the tax collector because of his good works. However, we see the tax
   collector crying out for God’s mercy because of his sin. Wise men boast
   in the Lord and not the good things they do.

14. Pride in Your Possessions

   “For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires
   of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from
   the world.” (1st John 2:16 ESV)

   The world will teach us to find our worth in what we look like and own.
   However, this is the perspective of the proud person who is of this
   world. We have worth in God because He is the Creator of the world.

15. Pride in the Good Gifts God Has Gave Us

   “Thus says the Lord: “‘Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let
   not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in
   his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands
   and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice,
   and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares
   the Lord.'” (Jeremiah 9:23-24 ESV)

   It would be easy for us to boast about the things that we are good at
   or have a lot of. However, that comes from pride because everything we
   have comes from God. Instead, we should boast in God because we get
   everything from Him!

16. Pride Prevents Us from Serving Others

   “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count
   others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only
   to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.”
   (Philippians 2:3-4 ESV)

   Humility is the exact opposite of pride. Pride tells us to put
   ourselves at the center of the universe. However, humility actually
   calls us to love and serve the people around us by looking out for
   their interests.

17. Hidden Pride in the Disciples

   “An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. But
   Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him
   by his side and said to them, ‘”Whoever receives this child in my name
   receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he
   who is least among you all is the one who is great.”‘ (Luke 9:46-48
   ESV)

   People often have pride and do not even know it is hiding in their
   hearts. For example, when the disciples are fighting over who will be
   the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, Jesus shows them that those who
   are greatest have nothing to do with position but has to do with those
   who are willing to serve.

   Jonathan Edwards, who was one of America’s most important theologians
   and died in 1758, wrote an essay called Undetected Spiritual Pride. He
   listed seven sneaky (or subtle) symptoms of pride. They are:
    1. Price: the Great Fault-Finder
          + This is when we criticize other people or note how they don’t
            measure up.
    2. Pride: Ministering in a Harsh Spirit
          + This is when we are unkind to others, even other Christians,
            and do not treat them as Christ treats them.
    3. Pride: Putting on Pretenses
          + This is when we act differently than we are, because we want
            to please others.
    4. Pride: Takes Offense Easily
          + This is when we act mean or bitterly when we have been
            offended, instead of being quiet and letting God be the Judge.
    5. Pride: Presumption Before God and Man
          + This is when we are too bold or confident before God, instead
            of treating him with the awe and reverence He deserves.
    6. Pride: Hungry for Attention
          + This is when we do things because we want to be noticed, or we
            think everyone needs our help.
    7. Pride: Neglecting Others
          + This is when we avoid others, especially those who we view to
            be sinful or unteachable. Instead, as Christ came down to our
            level, so should we with others who need spiritual guidance.

   Reading and understanding these symptoms of spiritual pride show us
   “the main door by which the devil comes into the hearts of those who
   are zealous for the advancement of Christ.” (Jonathan Edwards) He says
   that spiritual pride is so important because from it comes all the
   other bad behaviors that lead us astray.

18. Pride in Building a Tower to Reach God

   “Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with
   its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we
   be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.'” (Genesis 11:4 ESV)

   At this point in history, there was one language. In this Bible verse,
   the proud people think that they can build a tower to God and be better
   than Him. Since God hates pride, He humbles the people by changing
   their languages and spreading them worldwide.

19. Herod Tries to Be God

   “On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon
   the throne, and delivered an oration to them. And the people were
   shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!” Immediately an angel
   of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and
   he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.” (Acts 12:21-23 ESV)

   Herod puts himself in the place of God by allowing people to worship
   him as a god. The ultimate sign of pride is thinking and allowing
   others to believe that you are God.

20. Pharaoh Refuses to Listen to God

   “Then the Lord said to Moses, ‘Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus
   says the Lord, ‘Let my people go, that they may serve me’…But when
   Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would
   not listen to them, as the Lord had said.” (Exodus 8:1 &amp; 15 ESV)

   God tells Pharoah by the mouth of Moses to let His people, the
   Israelites, go from slavery under the Egyptians so that they may serve
   the Lord. In a sign of his pride, Pharaoh tells God “no” multiple
   times, is plagued, repents, and then tells God “no” again.

   God plagued Pharoah a total of ten different times:
     * Water turned to blood
     * Frogs from the Nile River
     * Lice arising out of dust
     * Swarms of flies
     * Death of the livestock
     * Boils and sores
     * Hail of fire
     * Locusts
     * Three days of darkness
     * Death of all firstborn

   God continued to give Pharoah chances to obey Him, and began the
   plagues with the least harm to increasing harm as Pharoah continued to
   renege on his promises in his displays of self-righteous pride.

21. The Pride of Haughty Eyes

   “Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin.”
   (Proverbs 21:4 ESV)

   Haughty eyes are often associated with looking down at others. This
   shows that your heart is full of pride because you think you are better
   than others. Instead of looking down on others, we should be looking up
   to God and praying to Him for humble hearts because God gives grace to
   the humble.

   Jesus did not look down on people based on intellect, wealthy, social
   status, education, criminal background, or based on any of the ways we
   so often sadly see in this world today. We are called to love and walk
   in the image of Christ.

22. The Deception of Pride

   “For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives
   himself.” (Galatians 6:3 ESV)

   Prideful people think that they are something special, when none of us
   can compare to God. The good news is that even though we are not
   something, our God is. We get to know the one who created it all.

23. Uzziah’s Pride Leads to Death of Many

   “But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was
   unfaithful to the Lord his God and entered the temple of the Lord to
   burn incense on the altar of incense.” (2nd Chronicles 26:16 ESV)

   Uzziah is leading Israel successfully as their king, which leads him to
   go into the temple and give an offering that was not his job. While
   this may seem like a little thing, he did not listen to the rules God
   put in place. The consequences of pride led to the death of many.

24. Jonah Flees From God

   “Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
   ‘Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for
   their evil has come up before me.’ But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish
   from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship
   going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go
   with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.” (Jonah
   1:1-3 ESV)

   The Lord tells Jonah to go and preach about His grace in Nineveh, but
   Jonah does not want to because he does not want those in Nineveh to get
   a second chance. Jonah’s pride led him to run in the opposite direction
   from God. He had so much pride that he thought he could outrun God.

25. Loving Yourself More Than God

   “But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of
   difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud,
   arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
   heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not
   loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of
   pleasure rather than lovers of God.” (2nd Timothy 3:1-4 ESV)

   The last days are the period of time from the resurrection of Jesus to
   His second coming. During these last times, people will choose to love
   themselves over loving God by giving in to all the sin mentioned in
   these Bible verses. They will be swollen with conceit (pride) because
   they will put other people and things above their love for God.

Conclusion

   The Hebrew word for “pride” can literally be translated as “high.” The
   Hebrew word for “pride” can also be translated as “haughtiness,”
   “boastfulness,” “arrogance,” or “conceit.” As we see from every one of
   these 25 great examples above, sinful pride is when you choose to love
   yourself more than God and the people around you.

   Pride is the opposite of humility or being a humble person with a
   humble spirit and a humble heart. People full of pride choose to use
   God and others to lift themselves up. Where do you see yourself lifting
   up yourself or making yourself the center of attention over God and
   other people?

Examples of Pride in the Bible

   by Godsplanguidedsteps
   No Comments
   Featured Image

   Examples of Pride in the Bible are plentiful. However, there are three
   general characteristics that are described in the Bible for these
   prideful and arrogant people. There is one person who stands out as an
   example of pride in the Bible. That is King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.

General Examples of Pride in the Bible

1. The Prideful Tell Lies

   Those who are prideful will tell lies to make themselves look good.
   Anything to puff themselves up.
   proud, arrogant woman

   Now I don’t know if these prideful people start out with this intention
   or not. But we all have a sinful nature and when our eyes see it as
   good, then we continue on that path. And one lie begets another and
   another.

     For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be
     trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
     Psalm 59:12 ESV

   As we see from this verse, their words enslave them. A person who lies
   needs to remember all their lies so their story is consistent.

   These people have essentially linked up in following the darkness of
   this world. And the father of lies, who is Satan himself (John 8:44
   ESV)

2. The Prideful Mock Others

   These people who are acting with arrogance have a name, according to
   Solomon. Their name is described by their actions.

     “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with
     arrogant pride.
     Proverbs 21:24 ESV

   They openly mock others because they believe their views are subpar to
   their own. This is becoming more prevalent in this social media
   society. People are being “canceled” for not agreeing with their views.

   Being canceled is basically a form of rejection because our Christian
   worldview is being attacked. And we are not being allowed to have
   differing opinions.

   This is not new. As Solomon says, nothing is new under the sun. People
   have been canceled- aka rejected. And Jesus is an example of someone
   who faced rejection on a daily basis. He can identify with your
   cancellation.

3. The Prideful are Deceived

   While the prideful appear In this life to have it all, they really
   don’t. And are being deceived.

     The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts
     of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, “Who
     will bring me down to the ground?”
     Obadiah 1:3: ESV

   Example of pride in the Bible Pride robs a person of peace and joy

   This deception comes from their heart. They devise a plan that is evil.
   They think that their plan will give them the satisfaction that they
   desire. But in actuality, it robs them of the peace and joy that they
   are actually searching for.

     Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but those who plan
     peace have joy.
     Proverbs 12:20 ESV

A Biblical Character Example of Pride: King Nebuchadnezzar

   In the story of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar sieged Babylon and took
   captives, including some youth. Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach,
   Meshach, and Abednego, were four of those taken. These young men were
   wise and considered better than all of his magicians in the kingdom.

   Even though Nebuchadnezzar was a success in his conquests, he was a
   troubled man. He had dreams that no one could explain. And he asked the
   wrong people to explain them – the sorcerers and magicians. He was
   unhappy that no one could explain the dream so he declared that all
   wise men should be put to death. Unfortunately, this meant that Daniel
   and his friends were in danger. Daniel asked for a meeting with the
   king to explain his dream.

   That night, God revealed the dream to Daniel. And the next day, Daniel
   explained how each type of metal on the large statue in his dream would
   outline the victories of kingdoms that are more powerful than the one
   before.

   After describing the dream, Daniel is promoted to the ruler over all of
   Babylon and his three friends were over the affairs of the province of
   Babylon.

Pride on Display

   So Nebuchadnezzar made a statue like the one in his dream and commanded
   everyone to bow down and worship this statue. If they did not, they
   would be put into the fiery furnace.

   But Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego, Daniel’s three friends, refused
   to bow down to the statue. So in an angry rage, the King had them
   thrown into the fire. They declared that God could deliver them from
   the fiery furnace if He wanted to but if He didn’t, they wanted him to
   know that they would NOT serve or worship the statue (Daniel 3:17-18
   ESV).

   After being in a furnace, the counselors noticed there was a fourth man
   with them. And the king commanded that they come out of the furnace.
   Upon coming out, they were found to be unharmed and even their clothes
   didn’t smell like smoke!

   This amazed the king and he declared that no one should speak against
   their God because “there is no other god who is able to rescue in this
   way”(Daniel 3:29 ESV). The king gave glory to God for all that He had
   done for Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego.

The King’s Second Dream and the Fall

   You would think that after that miraculous display, King Nebuchadnezzar
   would bend his knee and completely destroy the statue. However, he did
   not. He asked his magicians, again, to interpret the second dream. But
   they could not.

   So he asked Daniel to interpret it for him. The dream describes how
   Nebuchadnezzar would no longer be king and be dwelling with the beasts
   in the field. Daniel warned the king that he should repent of his sins
   and live in righteousness.

   However, the king did not do that. Twelve months went by and at that
   time, he declared how Babylon had success. And how it was all done for
   his glory.

   Immediately, the prophecy happened and Nebuchadnezzar was no longer
   king. And he lived in the field with the beasts. Some commentators
   believe that the king was mentally insane and imitated the behaviors of
   the animals.

   After a period of time, the king came to his senses, repented, and
   honored God. He said that God is able to humble those who are proud.

     Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of
     heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those
     who walk in pride he is able to humble.
     Daniel 4:37 ESV

   Once he repented and humbled himself before God, he was restored as the
   King. And God blessed him even more because of his humility.

A Personal Example

   When I was prideful in my previous job, God humbled me. My job was
   eliminated and I had the choice to take severance and leave or take a
   position in another department. I chose to stay and moved to the other
   department. While it was a humbling experience, God taught me that my
   work is not about me. It is about serving Him and doing my best to
   honor Him.

   After two and half years, God opened up doors for me to take a job at
   another company. I have been restored to being a manager of people
   again and working for a company that is focused on cyber security. And
   I have been blessed even more in this position because I learned from
   that step of humility to give Him the glory in the work that I do.

   Are you walking in pride? Repent today, God is able to humble you as
   well.

An Advent Book: The Book of Luke

   picture of "prepare Him Room" book

   This advent devotional by Susie is different than most others. Most
   Christmas time devotionals are short and focus on the Scriptures one
   reads at Christmas. But this devotional contains the entire book of
   Luke – from the genealogy of Jesus, His birth to His death and
   resurrection.

   Susie’s writing is easy to read and it makes me feel like I am sitting
   in the room listening to every word over a cup of coffee or tea.

   Even though I received an Advanced Reader Copy of the book from the
   publisher, I am looking forward to soaking in every single word during
   this year’s advent season. Take the stress out of the Christmas season
   by making room for Jesus this Christmas. You won’t be sorry that you
   did! I liked this book so well that I bought extra copies for friends.
   I hope you will do so as well.

   This book is found on Amazon or at other book retailer outlets.

The Kings of Pride

   News and Features | Inside Report Archives
       | The Kings of Pride

   The Kings of Pride
   By Pastor Doug Batchelor
   An Amazing Fact: Joshua Abraham Norton suffered from delusions of
   grandeur. He preferred to be called His Imperial Majesty Norton I, and
   in 1859, he proclaimed himself Emperor of the United States. Of course,
   people were amused by the grand claims of this pauper, but while he was
   generally considered a little insane, he ate for free at San
   Francisco’s best restaurants and the city’s newspapers published many
   of his proclamations — including an order to dissolve the U.S. Congress
   by force and the construction of a bridge across San Francisco Bay. His
   humor and deeds were celebrated not only in the city, but around the
   world. More than 30,000 people turned up for his memorial after his
   death in 1880.
   Rudyard Kipling wrote the clever short story The Man Who Would Be King,
   a tale about two scheming 19th century friends. The former soldiers set
   off from British India in search of adventure — and ended up as kings
   in what is now part of Afghanistan. It’s a fascinating study of how
   their rise to regal power slowly unleashes the latent pride in their
   hearts, changing their characters and dividing them as friends.
   Most of us have heard the expression “power corrupts, and absolute
   power corrupts absolutely.” This is especially true for monarchs, who
   are exposed to the temptations of pride more than the average person.
   The Bible is replete with examples of men who would be king, and kings
   who wanted to be divine. In fact, we learn that sin entered our
   universe through the portal of pride …
   The Angel Who Would Be God
   In Isaiah 14, we find a fascinating portrait of the first casualty of
   pride’s poison. It’s the story of how the devil became a devil.
   Of course, we know that God did not create the devil. Rather, He
   created a dazzlingly beautiful angel named Lucifer, who was the highest
   of the cherubim, the leader of the heavenly choir, and the most
   intelligent and powerful of all the created beings.
   But all of God’s creatures are free to choose whom they will love and
   serve. Sadly, Lucifer made the toxic decision to choose himself over
   all others. He became hyper-narcissistic, enchanted by his own beauty.
   “How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! … For
   you have said in your heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt
   my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the
   congregation On the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above
   the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High’ ” (vs. 12, 13,
   NKJV, emphasis added). Lucifer clearly had “I” problems.
   As the wayward angel spread his disaffection among the other angels,
   eventually God had to evict him from the courts of glory. But that
   wasn’t the end of pride in God’s creation. In fact, it was the first
   type of temptation that Lucifer, now better known as Satan, presented
   to Adam and Eve. He told them that if they would merely eat the
   forbidden fruit, their eyes would be opened and they would be like God,
   implanting in their hearts and minds his own arrogant desires. And it
   worked.
   Ultimately, pride is a form of idolatry — making ourselves an object of
   worship. The proud aspirations of the devil throughout the great
   controversy all revolve around “me, myself, and I.” And in Ezekiel 28,
   we find a few more details on the many facets of pride that led to
   Lucifer’s fall — pride of power, position, possession, intelligence,
   appearance, and more. The chapter should be a wake-up call to
   Christians in the final era of human history, because these selfish
   characteristics still contribute to the fall of those who eventually
   grieve away the Spirit of the Lord. Indeed, pride is the invisible
   dragnet with which the devil captures the most confident of God’s
   people.

   The Pride of Power

   “Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down
   in the midst of the stones of fire” (Ezekiel 28:14). The Bible spends a
   lot of time on kings who were overcome with pride in their own power,
   which gives the one who wields it incredible attention and adoration,
   feeding selfishness to no end.

   Nebuchadnezzar struggled with this particular pride problem. At the
   zenith of his power, the great Babylonian king had a dream about a tree
   from which the whole world was fed and where every bird found a place
   to roost in its branches. Later he watches the tree being cut down, and
   the worried king seeks an interpretation. The prophet Daniel informs
   Nebuchadnezzar that the monarch is the tree who will be cut down.
   Daniel advises him to turn from his sinful ways, live righteously, and
   show mercy on the poor.

   Convicted by the prophet, Nebuchadnezzar manages to humble himself —
   for a while. As Babylon continued to grow in prosperity, as his armies
   continued to win battles, as all his building projects came to
   fruition, one day the king walked out onto one his palatial balconies
   to take in the glorious vista of his kingdom. He proclaimed, “Is not
   this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by
   the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?” (Daniel
   4:30).

   Sounds like the devil, doesn’t it? He took irresponsible credit for
   everything over which he was given reign. God took this precise moment
   in time to send a striking judgment on the prideful king. “While the
   word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O
   king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from
   thee” (v. 31).

   What follows is quite amazing. For seven years, God took away the
   king’s wisdom, intelligence, and power. Nebuchadnezzar became like a
   brute animal, going around on his hands and knees. His advisers didn’t
   know what to do with him. Fearing this might destabilize the kingdom,
   they refused to declare the situation to the kingdom’s citizens and
   released him to pasture in the royal gardens where he went around
   eating grass like an ox.

   After seven years, God had mercy and restored Nebuchadnezzar’s wits.
   But the lesson is as clear as the story of the devil in Ezekiel: God is
   the one who deserves our praise, no matter how much power we possess in
   this world. When God gives us the ability to influence others, we
   shouldn’t treat it as if we did it all on our own. We should use that
   power with deep humility. Because of his pride, Nebuchadnezzar lost
   everything. Pride can also bring Christians to a place where we lose
   our access to the kingdom of God, just as it did with the devil.

   Pride in Position

   “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so”
   (Ezekiel 28:14). Some people grow proud of their position at work and
   in life. It is part of the same myriad of issues the devil struggled
   with before he had to be cast out of heaven. Haman in the book of
   Esther provides another prime example of self-destructive pride on
   display in the Bible.

   The mighty Xerxes of Persia learned that a Jew named Mordecai had saved
   his life from an assassination plot. Xerxes wanted to honor Mordecai,
   but Haman, who had recently received a promotion of high honor from the
   king, had become angry with Mordecai because the devout Jew would not
   bow before the haughty noble. Haman became so angry, in fact, that he
   wanted to kill all the Jews in the land.
   As Haman’s inflated pride continued to fester, he bragged to his
   friends “of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children,
   and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had
   advanced him above the princes and servants of the king” (Esther 5:11).
   So when Mordecai continued to refuse to show Haman reverence, the noble
   flipped his lid. He presumptuously decided to build a gallows from
   which to hang Mordecai, certain that Xerxes would give him permission
   because of his own high royal standing. Yet before he could ask the
   king for permission, Xerxes asks Haman, “What should be done for the
   man the king delights to honor?”
   Pride, a distorted mirror that obstructs clear thinking and reason,
   allowed Haman to see only himself. Filled with conceit, “Haman thought
   in his heart, ‘Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?’ ”
   (Esther 6:6 NKJV). The noble quickly devised the most extravagant
   procession he could think of for himself — riding on the king’s horse,
   in the king’s robes, with the king’s crown upon his head, parading up
   and down the city streets for all to honor. Jesus said, “Out of the
   abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,” and this couldn’t be truer
   for Haman, who speaks as if he wanted desperately to be the king.
   Well, can you imagine Haman’s shock with what followed: “The king said
   to Haman, Make haste … as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
   the Jew. … Let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken” (v. 10).
   Haman was commanded to honor the man his pride so desperately wanted to
   murder.
   The Bible says, “When pride cometh, then cometh shame” (Proverbs 11:2).
   The story of Haman is a great example of the ultimate payout of pride.
   He was hung on the gallows he had built for Mordecai.
   This pride of position even infected those closest to Jesus. In Mark 9,
   we find the disciples arguing about which one of them will be greatest
   in Jesus’ kingdom. It was as if they had never heard one of Jesus’ most
   powerful lessons to them: “He who is greatest among you shall be your
   servant. And who ever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who
   humbles himself will be exalted” (Matthew 23:11, 12 NKJV).
   If you exalt yourself, striving for position and honor, you will be
   humbled by God. If you humble yourself, God will find a way to exalt
   you, in this life or the one to come in eternity. Do you feel as though
   you’ve been passed over at your job because of favoritism rather than
   skill? Don’t let it bother you. Be content to serve where God has put
   you. Christ in His time will lift you up.
   Spiritual Pride
   Spiritual pride is a hidden pit in which many unsuspecting Christians
   have fallen. It is especially insidious because it masquerades as
   virtue. The Old Testament King Uzziah was generally a good ruler, but
   he fell through religious pride. He thought he deserved the same
   privileges as the priests. King Saul also lost his kingdom after
   usurping the responsibilities of the priesthood.
   Jesus addressed this fatal flaw in one of His most familiar parables.
   “Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
   other a publican” (Luke 18:10). Here Jesus contrasts two people who
   belong to the same church. In Jesus’ time, the Pharisees were deeply
   respected for their religiousness, while the publicans were regarded as
   outcasts.
   In the parable, the “Pharisee stood and prayed thus … God, I thank
   thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
   or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of
   all that I possess,” while the “publican, standing afar off, would not
   lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,
   saying, God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:11–13).
   According to Jesus, it was the humble publican who went home justified
   (Luke 18:14). You see, the Pharisee was proud of his good works,
   believing that his spiritual deeds earned him standing and acceptance
   before God. But the publican had simple trust in God’s mercy. The
   publican is forgiven, but the Pharisee isn’t. We can’t miss that lesson
   if we want to grow in Christ.
   Spiritual pride is deadly — and it is the bane of the Laodicean church.
   When a person or church says, “I am rich and increased with goods,”
   that’s nothing more than selfish spiritual pride. And God has something
   to say about that. He says that we’re really “poor and wretched and
   blind and naked and don’t know it.” The more spiritually proud you
   become, the more spiritually poor you are. But those who recognize and
   admit their sorry spiritual state in life, who know they can be saved
   only by the grace of Christ, have an advantage in their humility. Jesus
   promises them, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
   kingdom of heaven.”
   In the classic Christ’s Object Lessons, by Ellen White, we learn “The
   evil that led to Peter’s fall and that shut out the Pharisee from
   communion with God is proving the ruin of thousands today. There is
   nothing so offensive to God or so dangerous to the human soul as pride
   and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the most
   incurable” (p. 154).
   That’s why Jesus said, “Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long
   clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, And the chief seats
   in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: Which devour
   widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers” (Mark 12:38 –
   40). These men, says Jesus, will receive even greater condemnation
   because of their unchecked pride.
   Are you encumbered with spiritual pride? Are you proud of your
   knowledge of Bible doctrines? Do you go to church mocking those who
   don’t go the same day as you? Be warned of the spirit of your heart and
   the reasons why you do religious things. Pride is the seed that Satan
   planted to get Jesus nailed to the cross. In Mark 15, we’re told,
   “Pilate answered them [the Jewish leadership], saying, ‘Do you want me
   to release to you the King of the Jews?’ For he knew that the chief
   priests had handed Him over because of envy” (vs. 9, 10 NKJV). It
   offended their pride that Jesus threatened their prominence among the
   people, so they killed Him.
   The Power of Humility
   We’ve examined the destructive power of pride in the life of great
   kings and God’s people. Let’s conclude this study with a little lesson
   on the restorative power of choosing humility.
   The Bible tells us over and over that God wants humble hearts in His
   people. It teaches, “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what
   doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
   to walk humbly with thy God?” (Micah 6:8, emphasis added).
   Pride is a compass needle that always points to self. But we can choose
   to resist that natural tendency. Through God’s Spirit, we can choose to
   be humble. The Bible doesn’t say we should ask God to humble us;
   instead, we are repeatedly invited to humble ourselves (2 Chronicles
   7:14). God can certainly find ways of bringing you back down to earth,
   and He will because He loves you. But that doesn’t mean you will humble
   yourself: Plague after plague fell upon Pharaoh and his people, but the
   selfish leader would not humble himself to save anyone, even his own
   son.
   I hope to live and reign with Christ someday, but that’s never going to
   happen unless I choose to embrace humility now, like Moses chose when
   he was alive. It is said about this unique prophet, “The man Moses was
   very meek, above all the men who were on the face of the earth”
   (Numbers 12:3).
   That’s quite extraordinary considering he had the opportunity to live
   in the palaces of Egypt. Moses could have been a proud king. He could
   have had the whole world bowing down before him; he could have been
   looking upon the pyramids when they were still glistening with gold in
   the sun. Yet he humbly walked away from it because he wanted to serve
   God.
   Guess where he is now? He’s in the presence of Christ, one of the
   select few already living in heaven. That’s better than being an
   embalmed pharaoh surrounded by dusty artifacts. And it’s all because
   Moses humbled himself so that the Lord could lift him up. We need to
   realize our true status if God is going to transform us from a worm to
   a butterfly.
   Be Like Christ
   The contrasting examples of Pharaoh’s pride and Moses’ meekness are a
   symbol of Lucifer and Jesus. And each one of us must choose to imitate
   the traits of one or the other. So here is a final unfailing principle
   you should know: God most exalts those who are most humble and humbles
   those who are most proud.
   Who is going to receive the greatest humiliation on judgment day?
   Satan, because he wants to be God. He exalted himself more than any
   other being in creation; therefore, he is going to be humbled more than
   any other. He who walked next to the Almighty among glistening precious
   gems is going to be thrown into the lake of fire. It is the biggest
   demotion in history. He wanted to go from creation to creator; he’s
   going to experience the opposite.
   Who humbled himself the most? Jesus, because He stepped down from His
   heavenly throne into the pit of humiliation and death out of love for
   His creation. Jesus was the Creator becoming the creation. Jesus
   “humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death. … Therefore
   God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above
   every name” (Philippians 2:8, 9).
   These primary characters of Jesus and of Lucifer are at war within us
   all. Never are you more like the devil than when you are proud. Never
   are you more like Jesus than when you’re humble, because that was one
   of the greatest demonstrations of His character on the cross. We each
   are going to copy one of these two models in our lives. For your sake
   and for the sake of God’s kingdom, choose humility today and ask God to
   help you.

Father's "straight pride" flag lawsuit against Denver Public Schools could
succeed in court

   "Straight pride" flag lawsuit against DPS could succeed in court
   (BUTTON)

   "Straight pride" flag lawsuit against DPS could succeed in court 02:25

   A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by one Denver Public Schools
   father alleging his two children have been denied their First Amendment
   rights to have a "straight pride" flag in school may stand a chance in
   court.

   "This is not a groundbreaking lawsuit. This is just a controversial
   lawsuit," said David Lane, a civil rights attorney based in Denver.

   CBS News Colorado has been following this lawsuit closely, which was
   first filed back on Nov. 10 by two Washington D.C. lawyers, Mike Yoder
   and ChadLaVeglia. The lawsuit argues Nathan Feldman, a father of two
   children attending the K-8 Slavens School in Denver, was denied being
   able to put up a cisgendered, heterosexual flag at school. He says a
   "straight pride" flag represents his children's beliefs and should be
   allowed on campus in the same way LGBTQ+ flags are allowed.

   RELATED: Parent sues Denver Public Schools for his children's right to
   have "straight pride flags" displayed in school

   A spokesperson for LGBTQ Colorado sent the following statement in
   response to the lawsuit:

   A Pride flag is not meant to be exclusive – it is designed to be
   inclusive. It is meant to draw attention and humanity to people who
   historically have been considered "illegal", ostracized, excluded, and
   for too long quiet victims of discrimination and violence.

   A Straight Pride Flag speaks "us vs them" wherein a Pride flag lifts up
   an "all of us" dynamic that recognizes the too often quiet and quieted
   LGBTQ+ community.

   This lawsuit has riled up a lot of discussion and concern on social
   media, especially among the Slavens School community. Slavens' parents
   created a change.org petition supporting the school's teachers and
   inclusivity and calling for Feldman to stop the lawsuit.

   "People are under the mistaken belief that offensive speech or hate
   speech is not protected speech. The U.S. Supreme Court has said the
   government doesn't get to choose and decide what is offensive, what is
   not offensive," said Lane. "If they're going to allow any political
   speech, they're going to have to allow all political speech of a
   related nature."

   Lane states DPS, a government-funded school, is required to allow this
   expression of speech.

   "As much as I may disagree politically with his position. I think First
   Amendment case law mandates that this school either eliminate LGBTQ
   flags and all flags of that nature or they allow him to fly whatever
   flag he wants," said Lane. "He is absolutely correct that this is a
   First Amendment violation.

   A district policy established back in January 2020,  supports the right
   of employees to post "rainbow flags or other signs of support for
   LGBTQIA+ students or staff."

   Lane, however, argues this policy cannot prohibit other forms of
   expression under the First Amendment.

   "A smart school district will either say, no we're not advertising
   political beliefs regarding sexual orientation in our schools," said
   Lane. "Or what's going to happen here is that if Denver loses this
   lawsuit, which they will, taxpayers are going to be on the hook for
   paying attorney's fees to these D.C. lawyers who filed the suit."

   As of today, a spokesperson for Denver Public Schools says they still
   have not been served with the lawsuit.

   Neither Feldman nor his attorneys have responded to multiple requests
   for comment.

Descendants of Black Civil War Heroes Wear Their Heritage With Pride

   A bold new photographic project asks modern-day Americans to recreate
   portraits of their 19th-century ancestors in painstakingly accurate
   fashion

   Photographs by Drew Gardner

   Text by Jennie Rothenberg Gritz

   Neikoye Flowers was in second grade when he came home and asked his
   mother about his ancestors. His classmates had been sharing family
   stories—perhaps they were Irish, or Italian, or descended from Native
   Americans. Neikoye’s mother, Janisse, wasn’t sure what to say: “I told
   him, ‘I know bits and pieces, but I can’t give you a full rundown,
   aside from: We’re Black.’”

   So she was taken aback a year later when a British man named Drew
   Gardner called and informed her that she was descended from a member of
   the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the all-Black Civil War unit
   featured in the movie Glory. “It seemed like a scam,” she says. A bit
   of research confirmed that Gardner was who he claimed to be—an
   award-winning British photographer who has spent nearly 20 years
   tracking down descendants of notable people and asking them to pose for
   recreated portraits of their famous ancestors.

   Janisse studied the sepia-toned photo Gardner had sent of her
   great-great-grandfather, David Miles Moore Jr. When Moore enlisted in
   April 1863, he gave his age as 16, but he was likely younger. The photo
   showed him with a baby face, holding a drum almost a third of his
   height. He looked a lot like Neikoye.

   Now it’s a warm day in 2023, and 9-year-old Neikoye is sitting on a
   couch wearing a dark blue Civil War uniform, playing iPad games with
   his twin sister, Judah. People of various ages are milling around the
   room looking like time travelers. There’s a college soccer player from
   Alabama, dressed in the same type of uniform as his ancestor Lewis
   Douglass. There’s a medical researcher from Upstate New York having her
   hair styled so she can recreate a portrait of her
   great-great-great-aunt Harriet Tubman.

   Even the camera looks like a visitor from another era. Gardner always
   goes to great lengths to recreate the original portraits, hiring prop
   specialists to track down furniture and fabrics from earlier centuries
   and having wigs and costumes specially made. But this is the first time
   he’s chosen to use period technology for a Descendants shoot. The room
   where everyone is gathered today is the Penumbra Tintype Portrait
   Studio in Midtown Manhattan, one of the rare studios that specialize in
   the kind of wet-plate collodion photography used during the Civil War.

   When it’s time to take Neikoye’s picture, Gardner calls out in his
   British accent, “Quiet on the set, please! Complete quiet!” The
   conversation stops, and everyone turns to watch Gardner slip a
   lacquered slide into the camera. He takes off the lens cap, fixes his
   eyes on a stopwatch and counts out loud to seven—then pulls out the
   plate and rushes downstairs to the darkroom. He and Sam Dole, an
   instructor and portrait maker at Penumbra, watch intently as the image
   of the drummer boy starts to appear in the photo tray. “That looks
   good,” Gardner proclaims with relief. “Yeah, we smashed it.”

   Gardner started photographing American descendants a few years ago,
   partly because he was losing interest in British ones. He’d already
   recreated portraits with descendants of Charles II, Oliver Cromwell,
   Charles Dickens, Horatio Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, William
   Wordsworth and Napoleon Bonaparte. “At a certain point,” he says, “I
   looked at all the portraits I’d shot and realized they were nearly all
   of white men.”

   In 2020, Smithsonian commissioned a U.S. installment of Gardner’s
   project, featuring descendants of Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Cady
   Stanton, as well as a Black descendant of Thomas Jefferson. “I really
   loved doing it,” Gardner says. “Then I started to think, ‘Well, it’s
   all very well and good that I’m telling stories about people who are
   well known, but what about the people who aren’t well known but have
   played an amazing part in American history?’”

   As a white Englishman, Gardner has his own connection to America’s
   origins: His country abducted about three million Africans, chained and
   forcibly transported them across the Atlantic to labor in British
   colonies. Gardner started thinking about the descendants of these
   enslaved people and how he could help bring their stories to light.
   “The starting point for these Descendants shoots is usually, ‘Are they
   descended from people the public would know?’” he says. “This is the
   first time I’ve flipped the project to say, ‘These are people you
   should really know about.’”

   He and his researcher, Ottawa Goodman, decided to look for descendants
   of Black Civil War heroes. It wasn’t hard to locate relatives of
   Harriet Tubman, a figure widely known for ferrying enslaved people to
   freedom but less known for her role as a spy during the war. It was
   likewise easy to find descendants of Lewis Douglass, a sergeant major
   in the U.S. Army who wasn’t famous in his own right but was the son of
   the famed Frederick Douglass. After that, the task got much more
   challenging.
   Descendants of Black Civil War Heroes Wear Their Heritage With Pride
   Louis Troutman was a member of the 108th Regiment of the United States
   Colored Infantry. The unit, formed in Kentucky, was composed mainly of
   formerly enslaved Black men. Thomas Harris Collection Christopher
   Wilson Troutman's descendant Christopher Wilson says the U.S. Army
   “very purposefully and strategically” put his ancestor’s unit in charge
   of guarding Confederate prisoners. “The visuals were really important,”
   he says. Drew Gardner

   White Americans more often know when they’re related to anyone even
   slightly remarkable. Many white genealogy buffs can trace their family
   trees all the way back to Huguenot rebels or Scottish chieftains. The
   information they’re seeking—such as names, dates, places of residence
   and family connections—is often available in the form of birth and
   death certificates, immigration records, marriage licenses, baptism
   records or U.S. census listings. Because so much of this information is
   easy to access, a white ancestry-seeker might go out looking for
   information and find pre-existing trees created by distant relatives.

   But Black families tend to know far less about their ancestors, and
   what they do pass down within families often isn’t published online.
   Emmaline MacBeath, a genealogist at the collaborative genealogy website
   WikiTree, says there are far fewer user-generated family trees for
   African Americans than there are for white people. One reason is that
   records of enslaved people are hard to navigate. “You have to be
   creative to find things using many different spellings, different
   birthdays,” she says. “And you have to study entire communities at a
   time. On slave schedules, there were just tick marks on a page—there
   were no names. So, how do we take this list of 200 ages, with no other
   information, and turn it into a list of actual people?”

   There’s also the fact that many African Americans haven’t publicized
   their family trees because they preferred to keep that information
   private. When Janisse mentioned Gardner’s message to an elderly aunt,
   she discovered that her aunt knew all about their Civil War ancestor.
   But she’d never said a word about it. “Back when my aunt was growing
   up, it wasn’t something to brag about,” Janisse says. “It was something
   that put a red flag on you, made you stand out in a way.” Like many
   African Americans, her aunt had internalized the message that life is
   safest for Black people who live quietly and humbly, without attracting
   attention or challenging the ways white people choose to think about
   the past.
   Lewis Douglas Frederick Douglass’s son Lewis Douglass, a sergeant
   major. Lewis joined the military as part of a wave of Black men who
   sought to prove, as his father said, that they were not the "craven
   cowards, without soul, without manhood, without the spirit of soldiers"
   that Confederates slandered them as. National Park Services Austin
   Morris Austin Morris, a college soccer player in Alabama, was always
   aware that he was descended from the great American writer and orator
   Frederick Douglass. But the Descendants project gave him a deeper sense
   of connection to Frederick’s son Lewis Douglass, one of the first
   African Americans to enlist in the Civil War. Drew Gardner

   “These are families who have always been told, ‘American history has
   nothing to do with you,’” Gardner says. “No one talks about the price
   their families paid, not only for their own freedom but for the future
   of America itself.”

   In the case of the Flowers family, Gardner and his researchers started
   out with David Miles Moore Jr. They were able to find records that
   included a filing for a military pension, dated October 18, 1897, and a
   mention in the U.S. census from 1900. That information helped them
   identify his offspring. As they worked their way down the family line,
   obituaries helped them find the names of grandchildren and
   great-grandchildren. Once the researchers found Janisse’s name, it
   wasn’t hard to find pictures of her family. She and her husband, Neiko,
   hosted a radio show and regularly featured their children on their
   public Instagram feed.

   Janisse and Neiko talked things over for a while before they agreed to
   let Neikoye take part. “He was the right age, the right height,” says
   Janisse. “Let him recreate that photo. Let him have this experience. He
   wanted to know about his history. So let’s do a deep dive into it.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   When the Civil War began in April 1861, the U.S. didn’t allow Black men
   to join the armed forces. Fredrick Douglass published an essay in his
   publication Douglass’ Monthly. “Why does the government reject the
   Negro?” he wrote. “Is he not a man? Can he not wield a sword, fire a
   gun, march and countermarch, and obey orders like any other?” Excluding
   Black men seemed to Douglass like a concession to the enemy. “The
   national edifice is on fire. Every man who can carry a bucket of water,
   or remove a brick, is wanted; but those who have the care of the
   building, having a profound respect for the feeling of the national
   burglars who set the building on fire, are determined that the flames
   shall only be extinguished by Indo-Caucasian hands, and to have the
   building burnt rather than save it by means of any other. Such is the
   pride, the stupid prejudice and folly that rules the hour.”

   The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, opened the way for
   Black men to enlist. The proclamation ensured that the military would
   “recognize and maintain the freedom” of African Americans and do
   nothing to stand in the way of “any efforts they may make for their
   actual freedom.” With that, the U.S. military went from excluding Black
   men to actively recruiting them.

   Douglass played an enthusiastic role. In March 1863, he published a
   broadside titled: “Men of Color, to Arms! Now or Never!” He wrote that
   slaveholders had made Black men out to be “craven cowards, without
   soul, without manhood, without the spirit of soldiers.” The only way to
   prove them wrong was to join up: “If we are not lower in the scale of
   humanity than Englishmen, Irishmen, white Americans and other races, we
   can show it now.”

   This was one reason the Confederates didn’t want to enlist Black men
   (along with the obvious potential repercussions of arming the people
   they’d been enslaving). In the last few desperate weeks of the war, the
   South did enlist a few thousand Black soldiers, but only after much
   debate. “I think that the proposition to make soldiers of our slaves is
   the most pernicious idea that has been suggested since the war began,”
   the Confederate politician and military leader Howell Cobb wrote in a
   January 1865 letter to the Confederate secretary of war. “If slaves
   will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.”

   This was exactly what Douglass wanted to prove. All over the North,
   Black men rushed to answer the call. By the end of the war, 179,000
   African Americans had served in the U.S. Army, making up 10 percent,
   and another 19,000 had joined the Navy. Douglass’ sons Lewis and
   Charles were among the first to enlist.

   At the studio in Manhattan, Austin Morris, a 20-year-old Division 1
   soccer player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is getting
   ready to recreate a portrait of Lewis Douglass. Morris has always known
   he was descended from Frederick Douglass, though he keeps a low profile
   about it. “I’m never going to be like, ‘Oh, look at me,’” he says
   shyly. “I tell my close friends, but I don’t really like all the
   attention.”

   It felt different to dress up like Lewis. “I was looking at his
   picture, thinking: I’m 20. He was in his 20s when the picture was
   taken. He fought in the war, and he was one of the first Blacks to sign
   up for it. That’s crazy. I couldn’t imagine doing that.” Wearing a
   uniform like his ancestor wore, its sleeves marked with the insignia of
   a sergeant major, Morris reflects on his own ambitions. “It makes me
   feel like I need to make them proud, to carry on their legacy,” he
   says, “to do things that will honor our family.”
   Harriet Tubman Famed liberator Harriet Tubman also spied on the South
   during the Civil War. On June 2, 1863, she led U.S. troops to a spot in
   South Carolina where they set fire to plantations, allowing hundreds of
   enslaved laborers to flee. Library of Congress Deanna Walz To recreate
   this photo with descendant Deanna Walz, the photographer enlisted the
   help of a Netflix costumer. Tubman owned a few elegant pieces,
   including a lace shawl from Queen Victoria that’s now in the
   Smithsonian’s collections. Drew Gardner

   None of the men in uniform today has ever served in the military, but
   many of their relatives have. Charles and Joan Miller are here with
   their adult son, Jared, who is dressed like his Civil War ancestor
   Richard Oliver. Jared wears a slouchy dark blue Civil War forage cap on
   his head. Charles wears a baseball cap with the words “Thomas Edison 64
   Vietnam.” “I went to Edison High School in Philadelphia, and we had the
   highest casualties of any school in America,” Charles says. The 64
   refers to the number of boys from his almost entirely African American
   school who died in a war many of them saw as irrelevant to their lives.
   Charles himself tore up his paperwork from the Selective Service when
   it first arrived, but after the police spotted him in the park singing
   doo-wop songs with his friends, they loaded the young men into a police
   van and brought them before the draft board. With help from a family
   friend, he was able to enlist in the Navy instead of the Marines, and
   he spent the war years serving in the Caribbean instead of Southeast
   Asia.

   Nobody had to draft Richard Oliver into the Civil War. The 31-year-old
   Black laborer from Upstate New York volunteered the day after Christmas
   in 1863, leaving his wife and two children and traveling south with the
   20th Colored Infantry. Although Oliver survived the war, he died of
   malaria on the journey home and never saw his family again.

   A framed portrait of Oliver made its way down through the generations
   until it ended up in the hands of Charles’ wife, Joan. No one in her
   family knew the identity of the young man gazing earnestly into the
   camera. Eventually, the Millers connected with a local historian and
   learned that the man was Joan’s great-great-grandfather. A local
   newspaper covered the story. “I feel humbled by it, really,” Joan says.
   “Because I didn’t know who the soldier in this picture was. And when I
   found out it’s like—wow. You know? I can trace back to him. What a
   wonderful feeling.”
   Andrew Jackson Smith Civil War hero Andrew Jackson Smith was awarded a
   posthumous medal of honor for risking his life to carry a fallen
   American flag during the 1864 Battle of Honey Hill. State Library of
   Massachusetts Kwesi Bowman “My granddad has the medal at his house,”
   said Smith’s descendant Kwesi Bowman. “I wish he was here, but he just
   had surgery, so he couldn’t make it. I’m doing this for him.” Drew
   Gardner

   Christopher Wilson is marching around the room with a replica of an
   1853 Enfield rifle in the crook of his right arm. “I actually grew up
   with one of these. We had one over our fireplace in Detroit. And every
   time my parents weren’t home,” he adds, “I’d take it down and play
   Civil War in the living room.”

   Wilson is the director of experience design at the National Museum of
   American History, but he’s here today because he’s the
   great-great-grandson of Louis Troutman, a private in the 108th Regiment
   of the U.S. Colored Infantry. The unit, formed in Kentucky in 1864, was
   made up mostly of formerly enslaved Black men.

   Wilson’s main associations with the military came from his father, a
   veteran of World War II. While his father was training at Fort
   McClellan in Alabama, he and a few friends crossed paths with the local
   sheriff, who was riding around with some military personnel. The
   sheriff pointed a Thompson submachine gun at the young Black men. “Now,
   I know you boys are new here,” the sheriff said. “I don’t want to see
   any of you walking in groups of more than two down my streets.”
   Wilson’s father never forgot that moment. “He’s an American soldier,
   potentially about to give his life for his country,” he says. “I think
   he was really tempered by that.”

   Wilson has given a lot of thought to the way Americans talk about
   military history. He notes that the tradition of referring to one side
   in the Civil War as “the Union” and the other side as “the Confederacy”
   makes the two seem equivalent, like sports teams in different jerseys,
   instead of a sovereign nation fighting a group of insurgents. And while
   the war did set brother against brother—“One wore blue and one wore
   gray,” as the song goes—the institution of slavery did far more to tear
   families apart.

   MacBeath, the genealogist, says assembling Black family trees often
   leads to painful revelations. “Just yesterday, I came across a family
   that had been sold away in pieces,” she says. What’s more, the DNA of
   enslaved Black people and white slaveholders is closely intertwined.
   Such discoveries can be very emotional for descendants of both groups,
   says MacBeath. “Because what does that ultimately mean?” she says.
   “That somebody got raped. We have a lot of people who are just starting
   to realize this is what it is and they need to accept it, and that’s
   how they get a full family tree. And then there’s people who are still
   very traumatized by it and don’t want to talk about it.”

   Descendants of the Black Civil War hero Andrew Jackson Smith have
   always known they had a white slaveholder in their family, a Kentucky
   landowner named Elias P. Smith (also listed in some places as Elijah or
   Elisha Smith). In his last will and testament, Elias asked his son
   Harrison to care for two of the women he’d enslaved, Susan and
   Hilary—to “treat said Negroes differently from other slaves and keep
   them each comfortable and with all the necessaries of life as long as
   they shall live.” Susan was Andrew Jackson Smith’s mother, and it was
   common knowledge among both Black and white members of the family that
   Elias was Andrew’s father.

   When Elias’ white son William was serving in the Confederate Army, he
   planned on bringing his enslaved half-brother into battle with him. But
   Andrew managed to escape to the other side, joining a U.S. regiment. He
   fought in the Battle of Honey Hill, a failed attempt to block the
   Charleston and Savannah Railway. When Andrew Jackson Smith saw the U.S.
   color-bearer fall, he risked his life to take up the battle flags and
   carry them on through heavy enemy fire.

   In 1916, someone nominated Andrew Jackson Smith for a Medal of Honor.
   But the process stalled until his grandson, Andrew Bowman Sr., made it
   his mission to complete it. On January 16, 2001, President Bill Clinton
   invited Smith’s descendants to the White House, where he finally
   awarded Smith’s posthumous medal. “It was probably one of his last acts
   before he left office,” says Andrew Bowman Jr., who attended the
   ceremony with his father. He was moved that the president had taken the
   time to learn his ancestor’s story: “When he spoke about him, it was
   like he knew him.”

   Andrew Bowman Jr.’s 21-year-old son Kwesi is posing as Andrew Jackson
   Smith today. Kwesi was born after his family visited the White House,
   and he says it’s strange to be celebrated in this way. “I feel like a
   lot of Black Americans don’t really know what they are,” says Kwesi,
   who is a student at the University of Houston-Downtown. “I’m kind of
   jealous of people who do. I have friends who are Moroccan, Senegalese,
   Mexican—they’re all so proud of it. They’re representing, you know?”

   Kwesi pulls up the results of a recent genealogy test on his phone.
   About 80 percent of his genetic material comes from Africa: Nigeria,
   Cameroon, Benin, Togo, Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Most of his remaining
   DNA comes from Scandinavia and the British Isles. Andrew Jackson
   Smith’s white father is in there somewhere.

   As Kwesi talks, a longtime Civil War re-enactor named Calvin Osborne is
   busy sewing a patch onto his sleeve. Osborne got interested in Black
   Civil War history after seeing the movie Glory. He is part of the
   District of Columbia’s re-enactment group, Company B, and has been
   doing re-enactments for the past 30 years. In 2020, he found out that
   one of his own ancestors, William Lacy, fought in the war after
   escaping slavery as a young teenager.

   Osborne has supplied all the costumes and accessories for the
   Smithsonian photo shoot. The uniforms, crafted by a company in
   Mississippi, belong to Osborne’s fellow re-enactors. “This will be worn
   next week in Virginia,” Osborne says, adjusting Kwesi’s jacket. He
   points out the thickness of the wool. “If it’s cold you’ll be happy to
   have that coat on, but when it’s hot, not so much. They would march for
   about nine hours a day.”

   The 30 or so Black men in Osborne’s re-enactment group are on friendly
   terms with the white men who face off against them in mock battles.
   When asked what inspires the Confederate players to take part, Osborne
   says simply, “You’d have to ask them.” He adds, “Not all of the
   Confederate soldiers were slave owners. Some of them were fighting
   because somebody attacked their family. There’s lots of reasons people
   go to war, even today.”

   Osborne’s Black regiment generally has to surrender to the
   Confederates. “Oftentimes, Black regiments were given the toughest
   duty,” Osborne says. For instance, in the Battle of Fort Wagner in July
   1863, depicted in Glory, the U.S. Army sent the 54th Massachusetts
   Volunteer Infantry to breach a Confederate outpost guarding the
   Charleston Harbor. The Black men knew going into the fight that they’d
   suffer the heaviest casualties, while white soldiers would bring up the
   rear. Of the 650 Black men who took part in that battle, more than 270
   were killed, wounded, captured or presumed dead.

   Carolina, where the war began. The four sides list battles in which

   Is it demoralizing for Osborne and his fellow re-enactors to play out
   scenes of fallen Black heroes over and over again? “It isn’t,” Osborne
   says. “Because we’re giving honor to them.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   As the men mill around in their uniforms, Deanna Stanford Walz, a
   medical researcher, is getting her hair done. Her
   great-great-great-aunt Harriet Tubman almost certainly never spent
   hours at a salon, but Gardner wants Walz’s hair texture to resemble
   Tubman’s in a photograph from the late 1860s. Gardner also hired a
   costume designer from the Netflix show “The Crown” to recreate the
   blouse Tubman wore in the original picture.

   Tubman is famous for ferrying enslaved people to freedom, but she also
   played a crucial role in the Civil War. She slipped behind enemy lines
   and gathered information from enslaved people that could help the U.S.
   war effort, and on June 2, 1863, she put that intelligence to use. She
   led U.S. troops to the Combahee River in South Carolina, where they
   burned infrastructure and set fire to plantations. During the chaos,
   hundreds of enslaved laborers fled into the gunboats. Tubman said
   later, “They reminded me of the children of Israel coming out of
   Egypt.”
   Courtesy of the Miller Family Richard Oliver, a 31-year-old Black
   laborer from Upstate New York, volunteered to join the 20th Colored
   Infantry the day after Christmas in 1863. Oliver survived the fighting
   in the South, but he died of malaria on the journey home and never saw
   the wife and two children he left behind again. Courtesy of the Miller
   Family Jared Miller Jared Miller is not the first member of his family
   to dress up as his ancestor Richard Oliver (left). His son once dressed
   as a Civil War soldier for a Black History Month project. Miller is
   glad to have both of these photos “to pass on to my children and my
   grandchildren, for them to see what we did for the country.” Drew
   Gardner

   Walz grew up in Auburn, New York, where Tubman lived out her later
   years. “We definitely spent more time talking about her than other
   school districts,” Walz says. “But I wasn’t really like, ‘Oooh, this is
   my heritage!,’ even though I did know at the time that I was related to
   her.” As an adult, Walz has a deeper appreciation for all the different
   things Tubman was able to do—she could navigate across different types
   of landscapes; she could work as a nurse or a cook; she could disguise
   herself as an old woman or as a man. “She did so much, and I guess I
   have that in me, too. It’s in my DNA.”

   Gardner says these kinds of reflections have made this one of the most
   meaningful photo shoots of his career. “There was a moment where I
   looked to the other end of the room and I saw all the descendants
   together,” he says later. “They were all asking, ‘Who were you related
   to?’ All these people were talking about their histories. It made me
   think about how much it would help society in the United States if more
   people could come together and have a better understanding of their
   shared history.”

   Before the Flowers family leaves for the day, Gardner tells them he’s
   invited a curator from the Massachusetts Historical Society, Mary E.
   Yacovone, to take the train down from Boston and tell them more about
   their ancestor. Yacovone knows a great deal about the 54th
   Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, a unit of Black men from throughout
   the United States. “There were big free populations of color but not
   enough to fill all the Massachusetts regiments,” Yacovone says. “So
   people just came from all over because they were so ready to serve.”

   She steps forward and holds out a gloved hand. “This is one of the most
   precious objects in our society’s collection,” she tells Neikoye and
   his parents. She holds out a small lapel pin that Moore had made for
   himself after the Civil War. There were no medals given to young men
   like Moore at the time, but private jewelers filled the gap and
   advertised custom-made mementos in newspapers. Yacovone points a
   careful finger toward the lapel pin. “It’s got his name and his
   regiment and the dates of the battles where he fought.” After the Civil
   War, Moore continued his military career. The 1870 U.S. census showed
   him serving with the 25th U.S. Infantry at Fort Clark in Texas.

   Neikoye and Judah put on white gloves so they can hold their ancestor’s
   memento and think about the pride he must have felt when he spent his
   own money to have it made. “They’re going to remember everything about
   this trip,” Janisse says, watching her 9-year-old twins. “And hopefully
   it turns that page in history where they can brag about this to their
   kids and grandkids.” When they do, they’ll have the pictures to go with
   it.

   Correction, December 15, 2023: An earlier version of this article
   incorrecly stated the U.S. regiment that Andrew Jackson Smith joined.
   While he worked as a servant to a major in the 41st Illinois Volunteer
   Infantry Regiment, he ultimately enlisted in the 55th Massachusetts
   Volunteer Infantry Regiment, with whom he fought in the Battle of Honey
   Hill. The article also misstated that it was Smith’s father who wanted
   to bring him into battle; in fact, it was his half-brother.

   Earlier this year, the NHL banned players from wearing jerseys and
   other equipment coinciding with their respective team’s theme nights on
   the ice.

   But on Thursday, the New Jersey Devils found a way for players to don
   such sweaters off the ice.

   The Devils are holding a "Hockey is for Everyone" Night – essentially a
   Pride Night – on Thursday against the Edmonton Oilers.

   The organization had a local designer, Kathryn Kennedy, design
   Pride-themed sweaters, and members of the team entered Prudential
   Center wearing them.

   "Coming out is certainly something that’s not always easy, and it can
   take a while for someone to feel comfortable enough to do it," Kennedy
   said. "I can only hope that this design, and Pride Night, helps someone
   else feel respected, even, and welcome.

   "These theme nights let people who are apart of their respective
   communities know that they’re seen, heard, and welcome, that this is
   something for them. It’s a huge honor to be involved in the Devils'
   Pride Night, and my hope is that I’ve created something that helps
   others feel accepted and appreciated."

   Coordinating with the league's policy, the uniforms were not worn on
   the ice during warm-ups. The Devils say they will be auctioned off.

   While the jerseys were not worn on the ice, members of both teams,
   including the best player on earth in Connor McDavid, put Pride tape on
   his stick during warm-ups. The league originally banned Pride tape when
   the new jersey regulations were put in place, but after players defied
   it, that ban was reversed.

   McDavid once expressed his displeasure with the themed jerseys being
   taken off the ice, saying he'd "like to see [them] put back into
   place."

   The Devils will also be holding "Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage
   Night," a "Black History Celebration" and "Gender Equality Night" this
   season.

   The Arizona Coyotes were the first team to hold a Pride night this
   season, with members of the team, similar to the Devils, entering their
   arena with such jerseys.

   Earlier this season, goalie Marc-Andre Fleury was threatened with
   punishment if he wore a Native American-themed mask to honor his wife's
   background. He did so anyway.

   The issue was brought to light last season when Philadelphia Flyers'
   Ivan Provorov opted not to wear the team's Pride-themed jersey during
   warm-ups, citing his religion. Other players and teams followed suit
   for various reasons, ultimately leading NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman
   to nix all themed jerseys to "keep the focus on the game."

Pride

   The feeling when you possess or have accomplished something that other
   people find praiseworthy. You feel vigorous and have the urge to show
   off to others.

   Pride is primarily about yourself, even when it is not you who did
   something that you are proud about. You can also be proud of something
   someone else did, who you associate with, such as your children or your
   favorite football team. People can feel proud of their culture, their
   family name, or their appearance, none of which require them to
   actively contribute to the praiseworthy thing^1. However, the opinions
   of others are of crucial importance, as best demonstrated when you
   purposefully do something that other people praise.

   Pride is a social emotion, and to feel proud, you need other people’s
   (real or imagined) confirmation that you have a reason to feel that
   way. Because of this, other people can also ‘be in your head’ and
   prevent you from feeling pride. Namely, what is praiseworthy is
   subjective. Things that may be considered good in a certain (cultural)
   group may not be praiseworthy in another (e.g., if you grew up in a
   family that greatly values academics, your athletic abilities may not
   evoke much praise). Moreover, what is praiseworthy is relative (e.g.,
   if you are a good runner in an athletically average school, you may
   regularly feel proud about your times; but if you move to a school with
   highly competent athletes, these same times may seem unremarkable to
   you). Thus, the more exclusive your quality is in your surroundings,
   the prouder you feel.

   Pride has recognizable features. Although its static facial expression
   (typically a smile or laugh) does not clearly distinguish it from other
   positive emotions, it typically results in a bodily posture, gestures,
   and behavior that are clearly recognizable: lifting your chin, looking
   people in the eye, walking confidently, or in extreme cases, raising
   arms above your head. In a way, you try to make yourself larger and
   more noticeable, as if to say: ‘look at me!’ You may also exhibit more
   perseverance in your activities^2.

   People generally find it very pleasant to experience pride, as it
   elevates our feeling of social self-worth and status^3. At the same
   time, many social groups, religions, and cultures (especially those
   that are highly collectivistic, such as the East Asian or African
   culture) believe that pride needs to be checked. Unchecked pride leads
   to arrogance and misplaced feelings of superiority (‘letting something
   get to your head’, ‘hubris comes before the fall’), and social groups
   typically do not tolerate members feeling like they are superior or
   deserve special treatment.

Do you say you feel pride 'for' something or you feel pride 'in' something?

   Do you say you feel pride 'for' something or you feel pride 'in'
   something? 'For' feels right to me, but 'in' seems to make more sense.

   There are two statements where I need it. One is 'pride __ country' and
   the other is 'pride __ army'

   I want to talk about pride as a feeling; as a noun. For example
   "Nationalism is excessive pride of/in one's country'. I don't want to
   say "Nationalism is feeling excessively proud of one's country" or
   "Nationalism is taking excessive pride in one's country" as those
   unnecessarily complicate the sentence. Just to clarify, is the sentence
   "The parade instilled in them a pride in their country" wrong?

     * @drm. I want to use it as a noun though. I have a list of nouns, so
       it would be weird to say in the middle of them 'proud of ___'.

       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:16
     * I don't have personal experience with it, but here says that you
       could say take pride in, while pride as a noun is just pride
       – drM.
       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:22
     * It would be helpful if you gave an example of the sentence you
       would like to use "feel pride for" in. If you mean to say "I feel
       pride" you might say "I am proud", like "I am proud of my skill".

   Neither of OP's suggestions is "standard" English. You normally either
   take pride in something or you feel / are proud of [it, him, them,
   etc.].

   enter image description here

   But note that idiomatically there's a difference between...

     1: He is proud of his work
     2: He takes pride in his work

   ...where #1 means he feels his sense of self-worth is enhanced by the
   work that he has produced (because it's of a high quality; he expects
   others to recognize this, and thus admire him for having produced it).

   But #2 normally means he takes great care in his work, with the
   implication that he himself wants to be "satisfied" with the results.
   There's usually no particular implication that he wants or expects
   anyone else to admire it.

     * Those uses are both verbal (I don't know if that's the word, but I
       mean they describe an action) though. I want to talk about pride as
       a feeling; as a noun. For example "Nationalism is excessive pride
       of/in one's country'. I don't want to say "Nationalism is feeling
       excessively proud of one's country" or "Nationalism is taking
       excessive pride in one's country" as those unnecessarily complicate
       the sentence. Just to clarify, is the sentence "The parade

       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:45
     * @N A: I suppose you could define nationalism as "taking excessive
       pride in one's country", but personally I'd avoid any variant of
       pride/proud in that context, since it's normal for most Anglophones
       (particularly Americans) to strongly endorse patriotism
       (having/taking pride in one's country) whilst decrying nationalism
       (an extreme form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority
       over other countries.)
       – FumbleFingers
       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:53
     * I was just using that as an example. I made it up on the spot.
       Okay, so let's look at patriotism instead. Saying 'Patriotism is
       taking pride in one's country' implies that patriotism is something
       you do, doesn't it? Patriotism is not an action, but a feeling.
       @FumbleFingers
       – N A
       Feb 17, 2016 at 14:58
     * You're quite right. That's why I personally would always write The
       parade instilled in them a sense of pride in their country. But
       this isn't really about vocabulary or syntax as such - we're at the
       level of "writing advice" here.
       – FumbleFingers
       Feb 17, 2016 at 15:05
     * 'Sense of pride in' definitely sounds a lot better to me. I think
       that's what I was missing :) Thanks!

   Slightly different meanings depending on how you word this phrase:

   I am proud of him - I feel proud because I helped him achieve something

   I have pride in him - I am proud that I am associatied with him

   I am proud for him - I feel empathetic pride because of his solo
   achievement

   You dont feel pride "for" something unless that thing is capable of
   feeling pride itself and you are emulating that feeling due to empathy.

   If you do something for "person", you are serving the persons benefit.
   If you do something for "object" you are attempting to obtain the
   object.

Diverzitu máme zakořeněnou v DNA, říkají elitní advokátky

   Projekt o historii, současnosti a budoucnosti žen v právu s názvem
   #PRVNÍCH100LET ve svém novém ročníku již potřetí spojuje inspirativní
   dámy právního světa i veřejného života a připomíná osudy žen, které
   jejich profesi formovaly. Své jméno s ním spojila řada předních
   advokátních kanceláří působících na českém trhu. Jak se jejich
   zástupkyně dívají na téma diverzity? A jak ji ještě více podpořit?

   Euro, říjen 2023

Kladný vztah k LGBT+ musí firma nejdřív vysvětlit zaměstnancům, jinak to
skončí průšvihem

   Zatímco na Západě je největším spojencem LGBT+ lidí spíše stát, v Česku
   je to jednoznačně byznysová sféra, říká Czeslaw Walek, předseda správní
   rady organizace Pride Business Forum.

Ego And Pride Quotes

     * [INS: :INS]
     * Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've
       ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
       almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear
       of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the
       face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
       Steve Jobs
       Life, Fear, Failure
       Commencement Address at Stanford University, delivered 12 June
       2005, Palo Alto, CA

     * The reality is that everybody makes mistakes. The issue isn't
       whether you will make them, it's what you will do about them. It's
       whether you will choose the path of humility and courage or the
       path of ego and pride.
       Stephen Covey
       Motivational, Mistake, Humility
       Stephen M. R. Covey (2008). “The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that
       Changes Everything”, p.215, Simon and Schuster

     * It is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than
       to lose that someone you love with your useless pride.
       John Ruskin
       Pride, Someone You Love, Useless
       17 Copy quote
     *
     * You're going to make mistakes. The key is to learn from them as
       fast as possible and make changes as soon as you can. That's not
       always easy to do because ego and pride get in the way, but you
       have to put all that aside and look at the big picture.
       Tiger Woods
       Mistake, Pride, Keys

     * Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.
       Emily Bronte

     * All peace-loving women shut up when they sense they have stepped
       onto Guy Turf. Guy Turf is a murky realm of ego and pride and
       chivalry and testosterone and heroism.
       Jeanne Marie Laskas
       Pride, Guy, Ego
       5 Copy quote
     *
     * Sitting with the poor and less fortunate people removes the ego and
       pride from your heart.
       Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya
       Heart, Pride, People
       179 Copy quote
     *
     * I tried to laugh early on about ego and pride... I do something
       great and then I do something really dumb and then I laugh. You'll
       always be that kid.
       Matthew Ashford
       Kids, Pride, Laughing
       4 Copy quote
     *
     * In Business School they taught us about cash flow, not about
       corporate politics; about return on equity, not about egos and
       pride. Oh, there were optional courses on 'Organizational Behavior'
       and 'Managerial Skills,' but these were a little too bloodless to
       convey what I learned on the job.
       Mary Cunningham Agee
       Leadership, Jobs, Business
       Mary Cunningham, Mary Cunningham Agee, Fran Schumer (1984).

120 Ego Quotes Examining Pride, Confidence and Purpose

   By Norbert Juma | Updated November 14, 2023

   Our latest collection of ego quotes that will help you stay balanced.

   A huge ego is your worst enemy.

   An inflated ego can lead you astray and ruin your life.

   It can destroy your relationships, prevent you from recognizing
   opportunities, and inhibit true success.

   Granted, we all need self-esteem and confidence to win in this world.

   But when confidence becomes arrogance, you risk ruining everything
   you’ve worked hard to build.

   If you allow your ego to take over, it can get in the way of living
   your life to its fullest.

   The good news is, you can stop it from bringing you down by adopting
   the beginner’s mindset, focusing on doing your best, and choosing
   purpose over passion.

   Instead of letting early pride lead you astray, remind yourself how
   much work is left to be done, not how much you have done.

   It’s okay to take pride in achievements or position but remember that
   nobody gets to the top alone.

   To help you stay balanced, below is our collection of inspirational,
   wise, and thought-provoking ego quotes, ego sayings, and ego proverbs,
   collected from a variety of sources over the years.

   Also, check out our most popular quote article, a list of short
   inspirational quotes for daily wisdom.

30 Pride Quotes, Inspirational Words of Wisdom

30 Pride Quotes

   Answer this honestly. Are you proud or prideful? There’s a fine line
   between the two. Pride is an important part of who we are, it’s our
   self esteem for a job well done and it inspires us to push forward and
   do our best. But if your ego takes over, that power is lost because
   you’re not tapping into the humility we should all keep close. Enjoy
   these Pride Quotes; I hope they help you foster healthy self-esteem and
   build your confidence!

   Pride Won’t Let You Learn

The way pride is ingrained in those who exhibit this sheer arrogance is that
it’s convoluted with a hint of ignorance and a dash of recklessness. In a
less complicated sentence, proud people are ignorant of the consequences of
their speech or actions.

   Most people think of learning as a one-way journey but learning isn’t
   the same as acquiring information or being knowledgeable about a
   subject matter.

     Learning is an experience — for you to be learned means you know,
     you act, you generate results, you tweak appropriately and you
     repeat until you reach a state of equilibrium.

   In a world where everyone is a life-long learner, very few are having
   an experiential exposure to the things they have become aware of. You
   may know of financial intelligence but you only would have learnt it if
   you’re indeed financially intelligent (this, your pocket will tell us
   not the words of your mouth.)

   Knowledge is puffed up. Knowing about something makes you feel so at
   home whenever it’s brought up. It gets so bad for some of us that we
   stop spending time preparing and improving because we’re sure that we
   know.

   Pride comes as a result of knowledge and confidence. You know what you
   know and no one can take away that knowledge. That knowledge boosts
   your confidence level and you’re ready to take on the world but pride
   wants you to take a piss on the world regardless of the beauty other
   people are trying to create on its canvas.

   For you to learn a thing, you’d have to come to terms with the fact
   that you haven’t experienced it. You might have heard and read about
   it, but you haven’t had a real-time meet with it and pride won’t let
   you think this.

     Pride confuses ignorance as just a lack of knowledge issue. But real
     intelligence knows ignorance is also inadequate information or
     knowledge. Ignorance is knowledge that isn’t yielding appropriate
     results.

   If there’s anything you know about, have read about or are studying
   that isn’t generating your envisioned consequence, there’s an ignorance
   gap and pride might not let you accept this sheer and cold truth.

   So, you keep feeding yourself with more updates and latest information
   thinking that staying in touch would somehow create that learning
   experience but by the time you’d found that you were wrong, the guy you
   think lacks self-esteem is far gone because he was humble enough to
   accept his ignorance and put himself to learning.

   The truth about this is that it isn’t only job or skills related; even
   those mindsets and worldviews you hold would remain the same for as
   long as you live if you don’t step out of what you think you know and
   put yourself to learn what is happening.

   People hold different opinions of different things — from frivolous
   disputes such as being a vegetarian to grander matters such as
   providing for their aged parents and they are only one learning
   experience away to coming to a working formula.

   I don’t believe in everyone living their truths — my thought on this is
   people come to terms with the things they have learnt and term it “safe
   space”, they stay there and want others to accept this half-baked and
   one-sided versions of their lives. And because we live in a connected
   world, people can’t mind their businesses.

Don’t let pride shut the door against the life you really want. Call for
help, heck! Scream for it. Get on your knees, put on your dungarees, get your
hands dirty and get to work. Call up someone to teach you if you can. Pay for
that workshop to learn that skill that you know is relevant for where you’re
going. Pay for that consulting session. Send that email. Do the internship.
Speak to someone about the challenges you’re facing.

   In the words of Maria Forleo, everything is figureoutable, but the
   caveat is for only those who are willing to set pride aside and learn.

   Pride can only get you as far as it can but not as far as you want.
   You’re struggling because there’s something or a bunch of stuff you’re
   yet to learn and that’s okay.

   What’s not okay is to be okay with not knowing how to navigate from
   where you are to where you’re going.

   The crux of great writing isn’t when an action is taken but when
   transformation happens. I dabble in great writing and the occasional
   transformation.
