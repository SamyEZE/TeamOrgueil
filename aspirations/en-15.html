    “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-4" ><p id="pri-4">
    Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she, “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-5" ><p id="pri-5">
    Mr. Bennet made no answer.

    “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-7" ><p id="pri-7">
    “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-8" ><p id="pri-8">
    This was invitation enough.

    “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise-and-four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”

  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-13" ><p id="pri-13">

  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-15" ><p id="pri-15">

    “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grownup daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”

    “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them! Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new-comers. Indeed, you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-24" ><p id="pri-24">
    “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-25" ><p id="pri-25">
    “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humored as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-26" ><p id="pri-26">
    “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he. “They are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”

    “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-28" ><p id="pri-28">
    “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.”

    “It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.”
  </p></section><section data-block="root-73263-32" ><p id="pri-32">
    “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick tarts, sarcastic humor, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

Most of the tension in the novel comes from interactions between the rich and cultured Mr. Darcy and the second-eldest Bennet daughter Elizabeth, an extraordinarily witty and self-possessed female protagonist for her time. Austen\u2019s characters navigate the social, personal, and emotional spheres using both reason and sentiment to craft their decisions. In this way, the novel engages major philosophical debates that occurred at the turn of the century, such as the importance of upbringing and environment in shaping one\u2019s character and the relationship between knowledge and self-knowing. Austen\u2019s satirical, narrative voice throughout the novel, which points out flaws in the social system, was considered controversial because she was a female author, a profession relatively closed to women when she published in 1813. Using free, indirect speech to detail each character\u2019s thoughts and reactions, Austen reaches into the minds of her characters to captivate her readers. For this reason, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular and most beloved books in the English canon. \n","status":1,"literaryPeriod":"Realism","publicationYear":1813,"fleschKincaidGradeLevel":9,"readingTime":"10 hours and 8 minutes","isBookmarked":false,"readingProgress":0,"authors":[{"firstname":"Jane","lastname":"Austen","position":1}],"translators":[],"editors":[],"epubUrl":"https:\/\/owleyes-epubs.s3.amazonaws.com\/Pride_and_Prejudice.epub","category":{"categoryID":3,"title":"Fiction","url":"fiction"}},"chapterID":4584,"searchURL":"\/search","classrooms":[],"classroomsWithSyllabus":[],"tags":[],"showTags":false,"availableStandards":[],"showStandards":false,"classroomID":-1,"canonicalURL":"","loginURL":"\/login","tagURLTemplate":"\/text\/pride-and-prejudice\/analysis\/:tagURL","socialRedirectURLTemplate":"http:\/\/www.owleyes.org\/a\/:annotationID","classroomURLTemplate":"http:\/\/www.owleyes.org\/classroom\/:classroomID\/text\/pride-and-prejudice\/read\/chapter-i","subscribeURL":"\/subscribe","isTeacher":false,"readingMode":"normal"}

                    <div class="reading-footnotes__content markdown"><p>Michaelmas is the Christian Feast of St. Michael and All Angels (as it is traditionally named by the Anglican Church). St. Michael is one of the primary angelic warriors who fought against Satan and is considered a protector against the darkness of night. It was believed that evil, or at least negative energy, intensified in the dark. Families would therefore require strength during the darker months of the year, so Michaelmas is celebrated (in Western churches) on September 29—right as the days begin to noticeably shorten. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Feast usually celebrates Saints Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, and the archangels.</p>
