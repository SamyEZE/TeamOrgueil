   [220px-Allegory_of_Pride_Met_DP888806.jpg] Allegory of pride, from c.
   1590–1630, engraving, 22.3 cm × 16.6 cm, in the Metropolitan Museum of
   Art (New York City)

   Pride is defined by Merriam-Webster as "reasonable self-esteem" or
   "confidence and satisfaction in oneself".^[1] Oxford defines it as "the
   quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's own
   importance."^[2] Pride may be related to one's own abilities or
   achievements, positive characteristics of friends or family, or one's
   country. Richard Taylor defined pride as "the justified love of
   oneself",^[3] as opposed to false pride or narcissism. Similarly, St.
   Augustine defined it as "the love of one's own excellence",^[4] and
   Meher Baba called it "the specific feeling through which egoism
   manifests."^[5]

   Philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a
   complex secondary emotion that requires the development of a sense of
   self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that
   pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based
   interaction with others.^[6] Some social psychologists identify the
   nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional,
   automatically perceived signal of high social status.^[7]

   Pride may be considered the opposite of shame or of humility,^[8]
   sometimes as proper or as a virtue, and sometimes as corrupt or as a
   vice. With a positive connotation, pride refers to a content sense of
   attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward
   a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent
   self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging. Other possible
   objects of pride are one's ethnicity, and one's sex identity (for
   example LGBT pride).^[citation needed] With a negative connotation
   pride refers to a foolishly^[9] and irrationally corrupt sense of one's
   personal value, status or accomplishments,^[10] used synonymously with
   hubris.

   While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw)
   consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions
   consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in
   Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root
   of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known
   as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed
   as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt,
   vanity, or vainglory.

Ancient Greek philosophy[edit]

   Aristotle identified pride (megalopsuchia, variously translated as
   proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity)^[13] as the crown
   of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and
   humility, thus:

--
     naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own
     superiority the greater.^[15]

   Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for
   Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing
   from pride.

Psychology[edit]

   Pride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and
   evaluative; its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the
   self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies
   with.^[10] The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame
   as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of
   oneself and one's behavior according to internal and external
   standards.^[16] Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a
   standard; guilt or shame from defying it. There is a lack of research
   that addresses pride, perhaps because it is despised as well as valued
   in the individualist West, where it is experienced as pleasurable.^[17]

  Emotion[edit]

   In psychological terms, positive pride is "a pleasant, sometimes
   exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive
   self-evaluation".^[18] It was added to the University of California,
   Davis, "Set of Emotion Expressions", as one of three "self-conscious"
--
   embarrassment and shame).^[19]

   The term "fiero" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to
   describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a
   personal triumph over adversity.^[20] Facial expressions and gestures
   that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or
   arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant
   status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in
   cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show
   that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is
   automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status
   in a group.^[7]

   Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded
   posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from
   the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in
   congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see
--

  Positive outcomes[edit]

   Pride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal
   goals; for example positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a
   person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person
   alone.^[22]^[full citation needed]

   Pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of
   similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak
   others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a
   hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid
   negotiations of conflict.^[23]

   Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It
   is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where
   the individual is proud".^[24]^[full citation needed] Pride is
   associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and
   outward promotion^[clarification needed]. Along with hope, it is an
   emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger
   and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming
   evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility
   of the effort expended.^[25]^[full citation needed] Pride can enhance
   creativity, productivity, and altruism.^[26]^[full citation needed]
   Pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically
   advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods,
   pride is associated with a lower GPA.^[27]

  Economics[edit]

   In the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a
   spectrum ranging from "proper pride", associated with genuine
   achievements, and "false pride", which can be maladaptive or even
   pathological. Lea et al. examined the role of pride in various economic
   situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because
   economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are
   linked together by the selfhood of the people who take
   them^[clarification needed].^[28] Understood in this way, pride is an
   emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial
   decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short
   term they would appear irrational.

   Jacob Matham c. 1592.

   Inordinate self-esteem is called "pride".^[29] Classical Christian
   theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and
   thus^[non sequitur] high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human
   problem, but beginning in the 20th century, "humanistic psychology"
   diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a
--
   people "regard themselves as worthless and unlovable." Thus, they lack
   self-esteem.^[30]^: 40, 87, 95 

   In the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled
   with the term, "Haughty".

     Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

   — King James Version of the Bible (1611), Book of Proverbs, 16:18

   Terry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as
   an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He
   examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride
   is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the
   experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does
   not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic
   psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front
   designed to protect an undervalued self.^[30]

   He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts,
   namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in dealing with^[clarification
   needed] what he calls a "deadlock between the overvalued and
   undervalued self".^[30]^: 112–13  Cooper refers to their work in
   describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as
   well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an
   appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:

     The "idealized self," the "tyranny of the should," the "pride
     system", and the nature of self-hate all point toward the
     intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt.

   A group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a
   group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other
   groups.^[33]^[better source needed] "[H]ubristic, pompous displays of
   group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of
   strength,"^[This quote needs a citation] while those who express pride
   by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and
   hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public
   and personal eyes.

   Research from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride
   correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement and promotes
   prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with
   self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes
   toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.^[34]

  Across the world[edit]

   Pride in ones own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally
   have positive connotations,^[dubious – discuss]^[35] though like
   earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have
   been known to commit atrocities.^[36]

   Types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The
   difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the
   U.S. and China.^[ambiguous]^[37] In the U.S., individual pride
   tends^[clarification needed] and seems to be held more often in
   thought. The people in China seem to hold greater views^[clarification
   needed] for the nation as a whole.^[38]

   The value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to
   be a running theme and debate among cultures.^[39] This debate shadows
   the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride
   shouldn't be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about
   which form of it is the most useful.^[39]

   Pride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures
   largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was
   popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late
   sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk

   In Germany, "national pride" ("Nationalstolz") is often associated with
   Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to
   be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate

  Asian[edit]

   The term "Asian pride" in modern usage refers mostly to those of East
   Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian
   pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had
   conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese
   religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged
   prominently during European colonialism.^[42] At one time, Europeans
   controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in
   anti-Western feelings among Asian nations.^[42] Today, some Asians
   still look upon European involvement in their affairs with
   suspicion.^[42] In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by
   adherents of Asian Pride.

   Black pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise

   White pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white

   white ethnic/cultural pride.

   Mad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that mentally ill
   people should be proud of their madness. It advocates mutual support
   and rallies for their rights,^[44] and aims to popularize the word
   "mad" as a self-descriptor.^[45]

   LGBT pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals
   should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT
   pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT
   people.^[46] The movement has three main premises: that people should
   be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual
   diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity
   are inherent and cannot be intentionally
   altered.^[47]^[better source needed]

   The word "pride" is used in this case as an antonym for "shame". It is
   an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement
   began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the
   first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year
   anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising
   between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of
   Stonewall Inn.^[48]

   Hieronymus Bosch

   In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense
   to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness,
   and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers
   to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one's abilities
   or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in that sense be
   compared to pride. The term vanity originates from the Latin word
   vanitas meaning emptiness, untruthfulness, futility, foolishness, and
   empty pride.^[49] Here empty pride means a fake pride, in the sense of
   vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but
   sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.
