   Metro Manila Pride is a volunteer-managed, non-partisan, not-for-profit
   organization dedicated to educating, equipping and empowering the
   Filipino LGBTQIA+ and their communities to work towards a future that
   recognizes and respects the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons to a dignified
   life without discrimination and prejudice.

   Three young femmes in ornate dresses sit on top of a vehicle decorated
   with plastic leaves. On the rightmost side, a person with full make up,
   red lips, and big circle ear rings looks at the camera, with their lips
   open as if speaking. Their costume is inspired by water, with a blue
   neckpiece with stones in it looking like waves. Their bra also looks
   like waves and has pearls hanging off it. Behind them is an umbrella
   with lime green horizontal stripes. The person in the middle wears a
   traditional looking costume with many brown and orange beads, holding
   up a fake bow and arrow. They are looking to the side, also seeming to
   chant. Their headdress consits of a colorful headband over their
   forehead and brown beads framing their face. Behind them is a
   rainbow-colored umbrella. The person to the right is wearing a pink
   dress, largely hidden by their left forearm and the middle person's bow
   and arms. They are shouting to the crowd, while holding a bright pink
   decorative ornament with light pink roses around it. Behind them, a
   rainbow flag waves.

   that reads 'RESIST TOGETHER'.

   foreground, a wheelchair user wearing a raincoat smiles and looks to
   the camera. They hold a placard that says 'LGBT+ RESISTING TYRANNY &
   IMPERIALISM' and 'GABRIELA YOUTH-UPD' under it. Behind them to the
   right, a person wearing a black dress is looking to the camera and
   holding up a placard that says 'KARAPATAN SA PANINIRAHAN IPAGLAVAN!'
   and 'SAVE SAN ROQUE' under it. To their left, a person wearing a yellow
   shirt is smiling widely and holding another placard and a black
   umbrella in their right hand.
