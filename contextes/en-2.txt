     * Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often
       used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride
       relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would
       have others think of us.
       Jane Austen

     * Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've
       ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
       almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear
       of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the
       face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
       Steve Jobs

     * Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having
       more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you

       competition is gone, pride is gone.
