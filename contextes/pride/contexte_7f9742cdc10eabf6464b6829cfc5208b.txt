25 Important Examples of Pride in the Bible

   [16]Mar 5, 2022Mar 8, 2022 by [17]Editor in Chief

   According to the Bible, pride is when you think too highly of yourself.
   Sinful pride usually involves you thinking and acting in a way that
   shows you think you are better than God and/or the people around you.

   Since not all pride is sin, let’s look at 25 important examples of
   pride in the Bible to learn exactly what sinful pride is so we can
   examine our own pride in our lives.

1. Jesus is Beat and Mocked by the Guards
--
   head.” (Matthew 27:27-30 ESV)

   C.S. Lewis said, “the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride.” We
   see pride, the utmost evil, in action as the guards take the King of
   the Universe, Jesus Christ, and treat Him as if He were no better than
   dirt. They beat and mock Jesus before sending Him to the cross,
--

   Simon saw the Holy Spirit work through the Apostles, and he wanted the
   same gift. In an ultimate act of pride, Simon tried to buy the gift of
   the Holy Spirit with money. He tried to take a gift that came from
   God’s grace and buy it for his prideful pleasure.

4. The Pride in All of Our Hearts

   “Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity,
--
   There are points in all of our lives where we sin by doing what God
   does not want us to do.  We choose to use the good things that God has
   given us for selfish pleasure. We are being prideful people by doing
   what we want instead of what the Creator has called us to do.

--
   When God made the universe, He gave the first humans, Adam and Eve, one
   rule. That was not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
   and evil. Due to their pride, they thought they knew more than God and
   ate the fruit anyway.

--
   Saul, who would later become the apostle Paul, who wrote most of the
   New Testament, persecuted the early church. Before Saul met Jesus, he
   was a prideful person who thought he was better than the Jewish
   Christians. Saul thought he had the right to beat, imprison, and kill
   them.
--

   The Philistine, who is Goliath, looks at the young man David and thinks
   David is not a worthy opponent to fight. Goliath’s sinful pride only
   allows him to look at the outside of David, not his heart. It is a good
   thing that God judges our hearts and not by our physical appearances.
--

   In the book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar makes a giant gold statue of
   himself and forces everyone to bow to it. The sin of pride is seen here
   by Nebuchadnezzar making much of himself instead of God. Later in the
   book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar’s pride leads to him having a very hard
   time in his life.

--
   a woman who needs the love of Christ Jesus, judges her and sees a woman
   who he thinks is the scum of society (as someone fulfilling mens’ lust
   of the flesh). This prideful person judges the woman because he views
   himself as better than her.

10. The Pride of the Haughty Spirit

   “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”
   (Proverbs 16:18 ESV)

   The book of Proverbs is full of teaching on pride. “Haughty” means that
   you think you are superior or that you have an exalted sense of
   yourself. People who have a haughty spirit are full of pride because
   they believe they are better than those around them.

--
   gives grace to the humble.'” (James 4:6 ESV)

   There is such a thing as good pride in the Bible. However, most of the
   time that pride is mentioned in Scripture, it is something we want to
   oppose. Often, people whose life is marked by this pride do not
   understand their need for grace or humility.

--

   Even though Judas traveled with Jesus for three years, hearing Him
   teach God’s word, he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. In a prideful
   moment of defiance, Judas thought he was better than Jesus and was
   willing to trade Jesus to those that wanted to kill Him.
--
   the one who humbles himself will be exalted.'” (Luke 18:9-14 ESV)

   Pride can be seen in the Pharisee because he thinks he is better than
   the tax collector because of his good works. However, we see the tax
   collector crying out for God’s mercy because of his sin. Wise men boast
   in the Lord and not the good things they do.

14. Pride in Your Possessions

   “For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires
   of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from
   the world.” (1st John 2:16 ESV)

--
   world. We have worth in God because He is the Creator of the world.

15. Pride in the Good Gifts God Has Gave Us

   “Thus says the Lord: “‘Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let
--

   It would be easy for us to boast about the things that we are good at
   or have a lot of. However, that comes from pride because everything we
   have comes from God. Instead, we should boast in God because we get
   everything from Him!

16. Pride Prevents Us from Serving Others

   “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count
--
   (Philippians 2:3-4 ESV)

   Humility is the exact opposite of pride. Pride tells us to put
   ourselves at the center of the universe. However, humility actually
   calls us to love and serve the people around us by looking out for
   their interests.

17. Hidden Pride in the Disciples

   “An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. But
--
   ESV)

   People often have pride and do not even know it is hiding in their
   hearts. For example, when the disciples are fighting over who will be
   the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, Jesus shows them that those who
--

   Jonathan Edwards, who was one of America’s most important theologians
   and died in 1758, wrote an essay called Undetected Spiritual Pride. He
   listed seven sneaky (or subtle) symptoms of pride. They are:
    1. Price: the Great Fault-Finder
          + This is when we criticize other people or note how they don’t
            measure up.
    2. Pride: Ministering in a Harsh Spirit
          + This is when we are unkind to others, even other Christians,
            and do not treat them as Christ treats them.
    3. Pride: Putting on Pretenses
          + This is when we act differently than we are, because we want
            to please others.
    4. Pride: Takes Offense Easily
          + This is when we act mean or bitterly when we have been
            offended, instead of being quiet and letting God be the Judge.
    5. Pride: Presumption Before God and Man
          + This is when we are too bold or confident before God, instead
            of treating him with the awe and reverence He deserves.
    6. Pride: Hungry for Attention
          + This is when we do things because we want to be noticed, or we
            think everyone needs our help.
    7. Pride: Neglecting Others
          + This is when we avoid others, especially those who we view to
            be sinful or unteachable. Instead, as Christ came down to our
            level, so should we with others who need spiritual guidance.

   Reading and understanding these symptoms of spiritual pride show us
   “the main door by which the devil comes into the hearts of those who
   are zealous for the advancement of Christ.” (Jonathan Edwards) He says
   that spiritual pride is so important because from it comes all the
   other bad behaviors that lead us astray.

18. Pride in Building a Tower to Reach God

   “Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with
--
   At this point in history, there was one language. In this Bible verse,
   the proud people think that they can build a tower to God and be better
   than Him. Since God hates pride, He humbles the people by changing
   their languages and spreading them worldwide.

--

   Herod puts himself in the place of God by allowing people to worship
   him as a god. The ultimate sign of pride is thinking and allowing
   others to believe that you are God.

--
   God tells Pharoah by the mouth of Moses to let His people, the
   Israelites, go from slavery under the Egyptians so that they may serve
   the Lord. In a sign of his pride, Pharaoh tells God “no” multiple
   times, is plagued, repents, and then tells God “no” again.

--
   God continued to give Pharoah chances to obey Him, and began the
   plagues with the least harm to increasing harm as Pharoah continued to
   renege on his promises in his displays of self-righteous pride.

21. The Pride of Haughty Eyes

   “Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin.”
--

   Haughty eyes are often associated with looking down at others. This
   shows that your heart is full of pride because you think you are better
   than others. Instead of looking down on others, we should be looking up
   to God and praying to Him for humble hearts because God gives grace to
--
   in the image of Christ.

22. The Deception of Pride

   “For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives
   himself.” (Galatians 6:3 ESV)

   Prideful people think that they are something special, when none of us
   can compare to God. The good news is that even though we are not
   something, our God is. We get to know the one who created it all.

23. Uzziah’s Pride Leads to Death of Many

   “But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was
--
   go into the temple and give an offering that was not his job. While
   this may seem like a little thing, he did not listen to the rules God
   put in place. The consequences of pride led to the death of many.

24. Jonah Flees From God
--
   The Lord tells Jonah to go and preach about His grace in Nineveh, but
   Jonah does not want to because he does not want those in Nineveh to get
   a second chance. Jonah’s pride led him to run in the opposite direction
   from God. He had so much pride that he thought he could outrun God.

25. Loving Yourself More Than God
--
   His second coming. During these last times, people will choose to love
   themselves over loving God by giving in to all the sin mentioned in
   these Bible verses. They will be swollen with conceit (pride) because
   they will put other people and things above their love for God.

Conclusion

   The Hebrew word for “pride” can literally be translated as “high.” The
   Hebrew word for “pride” can also be translated as “haughtiness,”
   “boastfulness,” “arrogance,” or “conceit.” As we see from every one of
   these 25 great examples above, sinful pride is when you choose to love
   yourself more than God and the people around you.

   Pride is the opposite of humility or being a humble person with a
   humble spirit and a humble heart. People full of pride choose to use
   God and others to lift themselves up. Where do you see yourself lifting
   up yourself or making yourself the center of attention over God and
