Subtle Signs of Pride in your Co-workers, Spouse, Family, Church Staff and
Everybody Else Around You

The Secretly Prideful Person
                           By Ronald McDonald
                           A friend told me the other day that I’m a very
                           prideful man, and I said to myself, "Dude's
                           just jealous". So I told my wife what he said
                           and she said, "Ah, come on. You're a humble
--
                           arrogant and all that." But later that same
                           week, I was reading a book that said the most
                           prideful people aren’t usually the bragging
                           arrogant types. They’re the nice friendly
                           helpful ones at work.
                           That got me to thinking that maybe my
                           definition of pride wasn’t very complete. Now I
                           really wondered, What are examples of
                           pride? So, I googled “Signs of pride list” and
                           “Spiritual pride” and couldn’t believe what I
                           found. I was all over the list. I read about 40
                           articles and lists written by well-known
                           psychologists, theologians, pastors and even
                           the Wikipedia entry and consolidated them all
                           here. I put them into 4 groups; Pride of
                           Spirituality, Pride of Knowledge, Pride
                           of Power and Pride of Appearance. So I went
                           back to my wife and said, "Hey honey, I think I
                           found out the root of all of our problems in
                           marriage and work and ministry and all that.
                           ME!!! I'm the problem. Listen to this list of
                           signs of pride that I found." I started reading
                           my list to her and she laughed and said, "Wow!
                           You are prideful. I didn't know that's what
                           pride looked like." So I asked her to pray for
                           me. And then said, "Oh, and there were some
                           other signs that I found on the list." Her jaw
                           dropped as I read hers. She said, "Oh no! I
                           didn't realize I was so prideful either. Will
                           you pray for me too?"
                           God had been resisting me. It was like his palm
--
                           that God is resisting you in your relationships
                           or business or church or whatever area of your
                           life? Only by pride comes contention.
                           There are about 24 different categories one
                           could be prideful in. Most people are pretty
                           humble in most categories and just prideful in
                           one or two. You’ll see your relatives, spouse,
                           boss, employees, friends and president all over
                           this list. But don't forget this. Pride is one
                           of the most destructive and heinous sins you
                           can commit.

                           Ever heard this? “Yeah, maybe I’ve got a little
                           pride. But if you want to get along with me
                           you’ve just got to grow a pair. It’s just the
                           way I am and you’ll just have to deal with it”.
                           For you to know you have even a little bit
                           of pride and not care about it, is to raise
                           your fist in God’s face and say, “Hey God, I
                           don’t care that I’m regularly walking and
                           living in this sin of pride and I’m okay with
                           not having all that great of a relationship
                           with you either”. If that’s you, then watch

                           a proud look, those whose pride wells up,
                           arrogant scoffers. “The prideful man – ‬‭will
                           be brought low, humiliated, disgraced, doomed,

                           Luke 1:51, James 4:6. This is a really serious
                           thing.
                           We’ll never conquer pride, but if we know what
                           it looks like when it flares up, we can knock
                           it back down before too much damage is done. If
--
                           look like, then they'll never know they need
                           help. I hope this list helps you understand
                           what pride looks like as much as it's helped
                           me.

How They Define Pride
                           Our SELF or Ego is basically who we are as a
                           person. It’s not good or bad, it’s just what
                           makes us, us. Unhealthy pride happens when we
                           do or say things for the purpose of people
                           praising our SELF or for making our SELF feel
                           good or putting our SELF ahead of someone
                           else's SELF. Pride wants our SELF to be
                           praised, get glory, be worshiped and be highly
                           talked about, even when we’re not in the room.
                           Unhealthy pride can give us an elevated view of
                           our own SELF that is not accurate, but we truly
                           start to believe it and act to reinforce what
--
                           questions or challenges the view of our SELF as
                           not accurate, the fireworks begin.
                           Here are some of the definitions of pride I
                           found
                              - Pride is being SELF-ish
                              - Thinking excessively about SELF
                              - Pride’s base is too much SELF-love
                              - Thinking the worth of our SELF is higher
                                than it actually is
                              - SELF-worship
                              - Preoccupation with our image or SELF
                              - Pride is narcissism (in love with our
                                image or SELF)
                              - Pride is SELF-centered or EGO-centric
                                (everything revolves around us)
                              - Pride wants to keep the focus on SELF
                              - SELF-ness
                           "Satan disguises submission to himself under

                           “Instead of being motivated by SELF-ish
                           ambition or vanity, each of you should, in
                           humility (THE OPPOSITE OF PRIDE OR SELF-ISH),
                           be moved to treat one another as more important
                           than your SELF. Each should be concerned not

                           the negatives are symptoms of pride) I

                           The same list of examples of what pride looks
                           like, is here twice, one after the other. The
                           first list immediately below does not have much
                           explanation attached to the signs of pride.
                           Further down the page is the same list, but
                           with a much fuller explanation of each sign of
                           pride with some links to deeper
                           explanations. If you don’t agree, then google
                           “pride defensiveness” or "pride depression” or
                           “pride low self esteem” or “pride critical” to
                           learn why so many people consider it a sign of
                           pride. But be careful not to judge a person's
                           heart because of their actions or words. You
                           can't always tell. A friend of mine, who is a

Pride of Spirituality
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re spiritual

                                for it. But it sounds spiritual for sure.
                           False Humility - Humility is seeing yourself
                           and what you do the way it actually is. Pride
                           is not seeing yourself or what you do the way
                           it actually is.

Pride of Knowledge
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re smart
--
                           Defensive when corrected or criticized - If you
                           ever get defensive in marriage, then you have
                           pride and it has to be dealt with. We think the
                           best defense is a great offense when our pride
                           is hurt. “With pride comes only
                           contention...”Proverbs‬ ‭13:10
                             1. Attack back when questioned or confronted

                             6. Mean spirited

Pride of Power
                           Try really hard to confirm the fact that
                           they’re capable. “But once he became powerful,
                           his pride destroyed him. He disobeyed the LORD
                           his God...” ‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭26:16‬

                           Low SELF-esteem or SELF-worth - Humility is
                           seeing your own SELF the way it actually is.
                           Pride is not seeing your own SELF the way it
                           actually is
                             1. Constantly thinking of their SELF and what

                           about their SELF is a very common one. Pride is
                           a major cause of depression for hundreds of

                           pride are what I found and copied down and
                           then consolidated here for your reading
                           pleasure. Most were on several of the lists.

                           places on this list, then you just have a
                           little bit of cancer. You need to be desperate
                           for treatment. Everyone is infected with Pride.
                           Don't be okay with it. This is serious.

                           their pride, and the LORD was not angry with
                           them for the rest of Hezekiah’s reign." ‭‭2

                           and I read the list and saw ourselves on it in
                           some places, we immediately pleaded with God to
                           help us keep our pride down and be more humble.
                           We don’t want it at all and we are really sorry
                           that we have been so prideful for so long. And
                           now we question ourselves all the time, “Is
                           what I’m about to say or what I just said,
                           prideful? Because we really don’t want to be
                           prideful, even though we still act pridefully.
                           But a lot less. This is exactly what God wants
                           from us. A humble spirit and a contrite heart.

                           body fat former Navy Seal, who has us by

                           around?” as Prideman keeps slamming us over and
                           over again. There may be 21 of the pride

                           you in that category. “God, I’m ready for you

                           You need to take over completely.” That’s what

                           your paddle and kick up your feet and take a
                           break. And that’s when the pride monster
                           catches up to you and bites you hard.

                           dog who eats the most is the one who gets
                           stronger and wins the fight. Pridedog is more
                           aggressive and pushier than Humbledog and so
                           pushes Humbledog out of the way and eats all of
                           the food unless someone purposefully pulls back
                           on Pridedog’s chain. That is when Humbledog
                           eats all of the food and wins. Here are some

How Extreme Pride Slips In
                           Particularly for public figures like pastors,
                           CEO’s, singers, athletes, actors and actresses,
                           pride slips in subtly and undetected. And after
                           several years of being innocently complimented
                           and praised, we start believing things about

How Humility Happens to Hard People
                           They say that pride is the last thing to leave
                           before a lot of people come to Christ. They’re
                           tired of trying to fight it on their own and
                           when they’ve tried everything else and have
                           been humbled, then they turn to God. They say,
                           “God, I’ve got a problem with pride and I’m
                           asking that YOU wage war on it. I’ll stand
                           aside. Please fight it for me.” Until a person

                           I was listening to a non faith based marriage
                           book the other day and the author said that
                           Narcissism and Grandiosity (both forms of

                           We clearly live in a self-centered (prideful)
                           society. So how wouldn’t that not bleed into

Pride of Spirituality

Appearing Really Spiritual
--
                           with good intentions, people think that God is
                           pleased when we don’t have things of value.
                           Righteous living. And then in their pride can
                           say, “If only those materialistic people were
                           as righteous as I”.

                              - They only talk about spiritual things so
                                that people will think they’re spiritual.
                              - Prideful people spruce up their public
                                prayers with churchy vocabulary or higher
                                volume that they never use when talking to

                                and think, “That guy is a real spiritual
                                man. He sure can pray”, then that’s always
                                pride.
                              - Practice their public prayers
                              - Prideful people often speak differently,
                                use a different accent or voice or put on
                                a different face or behavior to help

False Humility
                           Prideful people fake their humility. They try
                           extra hard to be humble for the purpose of
                           people thinking that they’re humble so they’ll
--
                           not True Humility. It’s called False Humility.
                           It’s just a matter of the heart.
                              - Prideful put themselves down as if they
                                are lower than everybody else. This may
                                even flow from a genuine desire for
                                humility, but humility is seeing your SELF
                                the way you accurately are. Pride is
                                seeing your SELF NOT the way you actually
                                are.
                              - Treat themselves badly - “I am not worthy”
                                or “I’m a loser”.
                              - Prideful people don’t easily accept
                                compliments. They put one hand in front of
                                you like they’re stopping traffic and with

                                you. If it had been God, then it would
                                have been WAY better than that”. Their
                                pride wants those watching to say, “Whoa,
                                that guy is humble. He must be really
                                spiritual”. The right response would be to

                              - Prideful people skillfully brag in a
                                humble way. “Can you believe how great God
                                is. They asked me to speak at the Prayer

                                about their SELF, they wouldn’t look too
                                spiritual.
                              - Prideful people tell you they’re humble
                                and say, “In my humble opinion”.
                              - Only confess insignificant sins - Prideful
                                people confess little sins and say things
                                like, “I really struggle with coveting my

Pride of Knowledge
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re smart

                           already.
                              - Prideful people say they don’t need to be
                                trained or educated because that would
                                mean their SELF wasn’t capable enough to
                                be successful without someone’s help.
                                Prideful people want to say, “I became a
                                successful and accomplished self-made man

                              - Prideful people think they have all the
                                answers to life and somehow don’t need or
                                see the value in other people’s

                                you, prideful people insist on a lofty
                                title or talk a lot about their

                              - Prideful people listen to others just to

Argumentative
                           Prideful people argue strange, new or
                           uncommonly held beliefs or doctrines and argue
                           them well so that people are impressed with
                           their intellect.
                              - They get the last word
                              - Prideful people don’t discuss their
                                differences with the hope of possibly
                                learning something. They argue to show how
                                much they know.
                              - Prideful people don’t hesitate confronting
                                someone to say what they think is right.
                              - They can’t handle being wrong.

                           shame. Prideful people measure themselves
                           against others. When someone near them does a
                           good thing, it makes their SELF feel inferior,

Pride of Power
                           Thinking that they’re more important than
                           others or trying to make sure people think
                           they’re capable.

Pride and a Controlling Nature
                           Here is a comprehensive article full of
                           psychobabble about why the need to control,
                           feel superior and be mean to others is such a
                           huge sign of

                           being in control.
                              - Prideful people control their spouse,
                                children, friends and co-workers.
                              - Prideful parents create dependent children
                                by providing everything for them and not

                              - Prideful people say it’s my way or no way.

Submission
                           Prideful people don’t submit easily and rebel

                           Prideful people don’t like being told what to
                           do. This doesn’t mean to not question or share
                           wisdom with our leaders, but without a fight,

Hungry for Attention
                           Prideful people get hurt and resent it if they
                           aren’t made mention of and recognized for their

                           Prideful people lie. They don’t just embellish

                                things they didn’t do.
                              - Prideful people don’t give compliments or
                                credit to people who deserve it because
                                they think it makes them look bad in
                                contrast.

                              - Prideful people don’t need to pray because
                                that would mean God did it and they
                                wouldn’t get credit for it.
                              - Prideful people shoot down other people’s

                           addicted to power and control in a compulsive
                           drive to gain approval and public recognition

Crave Importance
                           Prideful people feel and believe that value is
                           added to their SELF because of their status or
                           accomplishments. They feel that they are worth

Overachiever Pride

                           but thinking of your SELF less. [196]Here is a
                           great psychobabble article about why low self
                           esteem and depression is a huge sign of pride.
                           Humility is seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Knowing what is true about who you
--
                           comfortable admitting it because it’s true
                           about their SELF.
                           Pride is NOT seeing your SELF the way it
                           actually is. Not believing what is accurate and
                           true. If you’re a physically attractive person
                           but tell everyone that you’re ugly or if you
                           have a very likable personality but say that
                           people don’t like you, then that is pride
                           because it isn’t true. Prideful people who
                           aren’t very good at coming up with creative
                           marketing ideas or who are clearly not very
                           good at leading people, won’t stop insisting
                           that they are and are offended if someone
                           speaks the truth to them. Prideful people don’t
                           believe what is true about their SELF.

Embarrassed easily
                           Embarrassment is a sign that pride is being
                           attacked.
                             1. Prideful people think they’re above doing
                                lowly tasks and immediately think, “I, of
                                all people, shouldn’t have to do that.
                                That task is for someone lower than
                                myself.”
                             2. Prideful people fear people seeing them
                                doing lowly tasks because they fear that
                                others will think they must not be very
                                powerful or important if they have to do a
                                lowly task.
                             3. Prideful people wait to be served and
                                don’t often serve others because they
                                don’t think of others as more important
                                than themselves.
                             4. Prideful people think they’re better than
                                others. This one can be hard to detect
                                because a person can appear to be humble
                                and caring on the outside.
                             5. Prideful people are easily offended when
                                others question their motives or ability
                                to do something. They say, “Don’t you

                           them when someone who is their equal rises
                           above them economically or in social standing.
                             1. Prideful people believe others are envious
                                of them because “wouldn’t everybody be
                                envious of what I’ve got?”
                             2. Prideful are envious when the spotlight is
                                on someone they feel they are superior to.
                                Then they whisper to the person next to
                                them, “They’re not all that”.
                             3. Prideful people sabotage other people’s
                                work or don’t use someone else’s good idea
                                because they think that if that person is

Materialism
                           Prideful people try to impress with their
                           success by showing us their possessions.
                           Prideful people are not generous with their
                           money. They are SELF-ish and would rather use
                           their money to buy things that they feel
--
                              - Think the best defense is a great offense
                                when their SELF feels attacked (when their
                                pride is hurt).
                              - They condition people to NEVER confront
                                them again by attacking them back with
                                their past mistakes or failures so it
                                takes the focus off of the prideful
                                person’s problem.
                              - Prideful people make up excuses when
                                they’re corrected or criticized.
                              - Prideful people say things like,
                                “Everybody makes mistakes” or “you make
                                mistakes too” when they have no choice but

                           traumatic reasons for depression. Focus on SELF
                           and believing what’s not true about their SELF,
                           is a common reason. Pride is a major cause of
                           depression for millions of people.

                           God from birth. This isn’t about introverts or
                           extroverts
                              - Prideful people are very shy. They are
                                overly concerned with others’ opinions of
                                them which is usually a reflection of
                                being obsessed with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t invite people to
                                their home because it’s not nice enough or
                                they can’t afford to entertain big.
                              - Prideful people have a hard time sharing
                                their real spiritual needs or other junk
                                because they’re afraid they won’t be liked
                                anymore.
                              - Prideful people fear what people will
                                think of them and are overly consumed with
                                man’s opinion of their SELF which is
                                usually a sign of obsession with self.
                              - Prideful people don’t like reaching out
                                and being friendly at church or in other
                                social settings.

Pride of Appearance
                           They try really hard to make sure people think
                           they’re valuable and they believe their SELF is
                           more valuable if it looks good
                           Arrogance, Immodesty, Narcissism, Pomposity,
                           Pride, Self-Importance, Self-Love, Self-regard,
                           smugness, swagger, self-admiration,
                           self-exaltation, swelled head, conceited,
                           display, pretension, self-worship, show,
                           ostentation,
                           We should take healthy pride in our appearance
                           and do the best with what we’ve got and for our
                           spouse. Dignity is a good thing. But this is
                           not:

Understanding Why We Have Pride and How it Works
                           God wants us to be proud of our work or family
                           or to try the best with what we’ve got. And
                           when we’re recognized and affirmed for doing
                           well, it feels good and right. That’s healthy
                           pride. The apostle Paul said that he was
                           “proud” of some of the early churches.
                           When we’re supported, protected and affirmed

                           and worship of us starts and that makes us
                           think that what we believe about our SELF is
                           true. Pride can even distort our mind to think
                           that even our junk is good and right.

Conclusion
                           I really hope this list and explanation has
                           helped you understand what pride really looks
                           like and has given you a desire to not have it
                           in your life. And remember, don’t shoot the
