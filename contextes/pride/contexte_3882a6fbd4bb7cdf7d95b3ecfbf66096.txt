Parades but no public posts: which brands are supporting Pride in the wake of
backlash?

   In recent years, [112]Pride month has served as an opportunity for
   global brands to demonstrate their inclusivity – marching in parades,
   touting support for LGBTQ+ causes and blanketing merchandise in rainbow

   territories for marketing purposes, without expending political or
   financial capital to stand by persecuted queer people around the world.

   legislatures are passing laws restricting LGBTQ+ rights and
   conservative media personalities are demonizing trans people. Some
   companies have faced a rightwing backlash over recent Pride promotions.
   After a promotional campaign with Dylan Mulvaney, a trans influencer,
   sparked a boycott of Bud Light, its parent company, Anheuser-Busch,
   [114]put executives on leave and distanced itself from its own
   campaign. And last month, Target pulled some Pride-themed products off
   its shelves, saying customers had been threatening employees.

   Will pressure from the right cause prominent US companies to back down,
   despite track records of support for Pride? Some brands have maintained
   a strong commitment to visibly supporting the cause, but others are
   celebrating more quietly than last year – for instance, sponsoring
   parades but ignoring Pride on their social media accounts. Here’s what
   we know about their plans for 2023.

   The company has already taken heat from the right this year over its
   choice of model for a traditionally feminine swimsuit. The swimsuit is

Amazon

   The e-commerce site has participated in parades and concerts for Pride
   month. Last year, however, the Pride parade in its home town of Seattle
   cut ties over Amazon’s donations to politicians who have backed
   anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, according to Seattle Pride. The organization
   also opposed what it described as Amazon’s offer of $100,000 to
   [116]get the parade named after itself. In response to a Guardian
   inquiry, the company said it had “nothing to share” on its plans for
   this year, though it is listed as a parade sponsor. Last year it posted
   Pride content on Instagram [117]throughout the month of June. This
   year, as of 7 June, the company has no posts about Pride on its grid
   (although smaller accounts like [118]Amazon Music have been posting
   Pride content).

   and promoting a rainbow-colored bottle. This year the company has yet
   to mention Pride on either the Budweiser or Bud Light Twitter accounts
   or Instagram grids. The company did not respond to a Guardian request
   for comment on its plans for Pride month, but it does appear to be
   quietly sponsoring some parades this year. It has also [122]donated
   $200,000 to the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce amid criticism over

   The tech company, which has had a robust presence at its local San
   Francisco Pride parade, also works with [123]a number of LGBTQ+
   organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Center
   for Transgender Equality and the Trevor Project. For 2023, it is
   promoting a Pride-themed band for the Apple Watch, continuing a
   tradition of using Pride colors on the device that began in 2016 and
   was [124]expanded with additional colors in 2021 to represent Black,
   Latino, trans and non-binary people.

   The bank’s website has a detailed accounting of its support for LGBTQ+
   rights, and it has sponsored several major Pride parades in the past.
   It continues with parade sponsorships this year and celebrated 1 June
   on Instagram.

Coca-Cola

   The beverage company has sponsored major Pride parades and it continues
   to sell Pride-themed merchandise. It did not respond to a Guardian
   request for comment on its plans for this year, but it is listed as a
   sponsor of several parades.

Dick’s Sporting Goods

   The Pennsylvania-based retailer appears to have big plans for Pride
   2023, with a [127]list of parades on its site. It’s also promoting a
   broad collection of Pride items.

   sought to take over last year following Disney’s opposition to the
   “don’t say gay” measure. This year, it has a new Pride apparel
   collection and is planning two [128]“Disneyland After Dark” Pride
   nights for the first time in June.

Google

   The tech company has held “virtual Pride parades”, which use
   smartphones and headsets to allow anyone to join a parade from wherever
   they are. It has also participated in and sponsored real-life ones,
   including [129]this year. On 1 June, the main search site marked Pride
   with an article describing how the company is celebrating Pride,
   including highlighting certain apps and LGBTQ+ creators on YouTube.

   The bank describes itself as a longstanding supporter of the community,
   providing large donations to pro-LGBTQ+ causes, sponsoring Pride
   parades and working with advocacy groups. Last year, however, Pride
   Northwest, which is behind the Portland event, cut ties to the bank
   over its financial support for politicians backing anti-LGBTQ+ causes.

Kohl’s

   The department store is promoting Pride-themed clothing collections –
   and now [130]faces a boycott akin to the backlash against Target, with
   opponents tweeting their fury about “Pride merch for babies”. Kohl’s
   did not reply to a request for comment, but as of Wednesday the items
   appeared to remain available, and on 1 June the company marked Pride
   month on its site and social media. Last year, Kohl’s was a “gold”
   level sponsor of the Pride parade in Milwaukee, where it is based, for
   the first time. It remains a gold sponsor this year.

   The San Francisco-based clothing company, which has participated in the
   city’s parade, has launched a Pride campaign and apparel line for this
   year. Asked whether rightwing pressure on other companies would affect
   the outfitter, a spokesperson said Levi’s was “continuing with its
   Pride collection and marketing as planned”.

   participation and partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations. Maybelline

   The fast-food chain has participated in various LGBTQ+-themed
   promotions, including fries with a rainbow box. This year, it will
   sponsor several Pride parades, including in Los Angeles and Dallas.

Miller Lite

   appears to be continuing with it this year. It touts “town halls” in
   various cities where bars serving the beer can work toward inclusivity
   and sponsors events including the Dallas Pride Miller Lite music
   festival. In a statement to the Guardian, Miller’s parent company,
   Molson Coors, said: “Everyone deserves to feel comfortable having a
   drink and being themselves. That’s why beer, wine and spirits companies
   like ours have supported Pride for decades, why we’ll do so in 2023 and
   why we’ll continue to do so for decades to come.”

NHL

   Hockey teams have attempted to hold a number of Pride nights this year,
   only to see many players refuse to don Pride-themed jerseys. (In some
   cases, they may have had legal concerns given Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+
   laws; [132]5% of the league’s players are Russian.) Last year, the
   league [133]promoted Pride month celebrations; its plans for this year
   are unclear. As of 7 June, it had not tweeted about Pride; last year,
   it [134]posted to celebrate on 1 June.

   The beverage company has continued to broadcast its support for Pride

Starbucks

   The coffee company highlights its work on behalf of LGBTQ+ rights
   extensively on its website, including a timeline of its “history of
   inclusion”. This year, it is sponsoring Pride parades including in Los
   Angeles and San Diego. Meanwhile, it’s [135]facing boycott calls after
   airing an ad in India celebrating a young person’s transition. In a

Target

   The big-box retailer is offering an extensive Pride-themed apparel
   collection, but it has removed some items, citing threats to its
   employees. Experts have warned that the company’s decision could
   “[137]embolden alt-right actors”, encouraging them to believe that
   threats and boycotts are effective. As of 1 June, it was promoting the
   Pride collection prominently on its website.

   Despite threats to its big-box competitor Target, Walmart [139]says it
   is not changing its own Pride collection: “We have merchandise that we
   sell all year that supports different groups.” The company, which also
   promoted Pride month on its site and social media, says it has not
   faced threats of its own.

--
   The bank proclaims its support for LGBTQ+ rights, calling itself an
   early leader in the movement. This year, it will “continue to honor and
   celebrate Pride Month by supporting local LGBTQ+ organizations in
   several cities across the country and hosting employee celebrations”,
   it said in a statement to the Guardian.
