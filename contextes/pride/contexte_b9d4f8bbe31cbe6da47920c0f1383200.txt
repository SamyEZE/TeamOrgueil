Question

   What can we have pride in? Is there a good pride? I heard that we can
   have pride in battle as that gives us more strength or the feeling of
   strength, but my question is, does this mean any battle?

   If I was playing in a sports match could I have pride in myself? Also,
   is there a good type of pride?

   of translation from Arabic to English. There are many words in the
   Arabic language that translate into words of similar meaning in
   English. One example of this is the words translated as pride.

   The word Kibr (translated as pride or arrogance) has a very bad
   connotation, whereas, the word Fakhr (translated as pride, also) can
   have a good connotation. Let’s define each as they are understood in
   the Arabic language.

Kibr

   Kibr (pride or arrogance) comes from the word Kabir, meaning to be
   great. Thus this word means the state of a person who deems themselves
   great in comparison to others. This is always a blameworthy

   ‘Ulum al-Din]

   To act out one’s pride (kibr), either inwardly or outwardly, is sinful.

Inward Manifestations of Pride

   The inward manifestation of pride is explained in the following
   Prophetic narration:

   The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and give him peace) said,
   “No one who has an atom’s weight of pride (kibr) in their heart will
   enter Paradise.” A man (amongst the Companions) said, “Surely a person
   loves that his clothes look good and that his shoes look good.” The
   Messenger replied, “Indeed, Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride
   (kibr) is to refuse to accept the truth and to look down on people.”
   [Muslim]

Outward Manifestations of Pride

   The outward manifestations of pride are many. Here are some of them:
     * Walking haughtily
     * Allowing their garments to drag on the floor, to show their status

   to some of the above is in the context of standing up against
   arrogant/oppressive people. The Great Yahya bin Muadh (Allah be pleased
   with him) said, “Showing pride in the face of a prideful person is
   humility.” i.e. it is warranted in some situations if done with the
   right intention.
