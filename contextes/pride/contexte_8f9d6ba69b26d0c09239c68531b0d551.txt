     * [39]Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool
       I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
       Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride,
       all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away
       in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

       have to put all that aside and look at the big picture.
