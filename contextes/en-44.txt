   "Straight pride" flag lawsuit against DPS could succeed in court 02:25

   A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by one Denver Public Schools
   father alleging his two children have been denied their First Amendment
   rights to have a "straight pride" flag in school may stand a chance in
   court.

   "This is not a groundbreaking lawsuit. This is just a controversial
--
   and ChadLaVeglia. The lawsuit argues Nathan Feldman, a father of two
   children attending the K-8 Slavens School in Denver, was denied being
   able to put up a cisgendered, heterosexual flag at school. He says a
   "straight pride" flag represents his children's beliefs and should be
   allowed on campus in the same way LGBTQ+ flags are allowed.

   A spokesperson for LGBTQ Colorado sent the following statement in
   response to the lawsuit:

   A Pride flag is not meant to be exclusive â€“ it is designed to be
   inclusive. It is meant to draw attention and humanity to people who
   historically have been considered "illegal", ostracized, excluded, and
   for too long quiet victims of discrimination and violence.

   A Straight Pride Flag speaks "us vs them" wherein a Pride flag lifts up
   an "all of us" dynamic that recognizes the too often quiet and quieted
   LGBTQ+ community.
