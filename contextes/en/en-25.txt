7 Deadly Sins: Pride

Contributed by Stephen Funderburk on Feb 27, 2008

        | 5,721 views
       The first of the seven deadly sins, considered the root of all
       others sins. It was this sin that caused Lucifer to fall from
       heaven.
       The first of the seven deadly sins is pride. A simple definition of
       the word pride is an exaggerated opinion of one’s value and worth.
       It is the attitude of superiority over others. A biblical example
       of pride is the tower of Babel where the people said, we will make
       a name for ourselves. Tonight ...read more

        | 2,193 views
       Believers may not often realize it, we are either centered on man
       or centered on God. There is no alternative. Either God is the
       center and we have become rightly adjusted to him, or we are the
       center and everything revolves around us. How is power of pride
       broken?
       There are basically two types of evil on this earth - natural evils
       which include earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, flash floods, etc.

Those Feelings Of Pride Series

Contributed by David Owens on Apr 12, 2021
        | 4,047 views
       God has given us the ability to feel the emotion of pride so that
       we can benefit from good pride and avoid the destructive nature of
       bad pride. It is important to know the difference between the two
       kinds of pride.
       A. Once there was a guy named Zeke who had so much pride he could
       never admit he was wrong. 1. One day Zeke wandered into the
       blacksmith shop with sawdust all over the floor. 2. A few minutes
       before Zeke arrived, the blacksmith had been working on an
