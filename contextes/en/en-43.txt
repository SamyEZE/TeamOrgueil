   It’s wise for us to be aware of signs of pride in ourselves.

41 Key Signs of Pride

    1. Do you look down on those who are less educated, less affluent,
       less refined or less successful than yourself?
    2. Do you think of yourself as more spiritual than your mate, others
       in your in your church?
    3. Do you have a judgmental spirit toward those who don’t make the
       same lifestyle choices you do…dress standards, how you school your
       kids, entertainment standards, etc.?
    4. Are you quick to find fault with others and to verbalize those
       thoughts to others?
    5. Do you have a sharp, critical tongue?
    6. Do you frequently correct or criticize your mate, your pastor or
       other people in positions of leadership (teachers, youth director,
       etc.)?
    7. Do you give undue time, attention and effort to your physical
       appearance—hair, make-up, clothing, weight, body shape, avoiding
       appearance of aging?
    8. Are you proud of the schedule you keep, how disciplined you are,
       how much you are able to accomplish?
    9. Are you driven to receive approval, praise or acceptance from
       others?
   10. Are you argumentative?
   11. Do you generally think your way is the right way, the only way or
       the best way?
   12. Do you have a touchy, sensitive spirit? Easily offended? Get your
       feelings hurt easily?
   13. Are you guilty of pretense? Trying to leave a better impression of
       yourself than is really true? (Would the people at church be
       shocked if they knew what you were like at home?)
   14. Do you have a hard time admitting when you are wrong?
   15. Do you have a hard time confessing your sin to God or others (not
       just in generalities but specifics)?
   16. Do you have a hard time sharing your real spiritual needs/struggles
       with others?
   17. Do you have a hard time praying aloud with others?
   18. Are you excessively shy?
   19. Do you have a hard time reaching out and being friendly to people
       you don’t know at church?
   20. Do you resent being asked or expected to serve your family, your
       parents or others?
   21. Do you become defensive when you are criticized or corrected?
   22. Are you a perfectionist? Do you get irked or impatient with people
       who aren’t?
   23. Do you tend to be controlling—of your mate, your children, friends,
       those in your workplace?
   24. Do you frequently interrupt people when they are speaking?
   25. Does your husband feel intimidated by your “spirituality”?
   26. Does your husband feel like he can never measure up to your
       expectations of what it means to be a good husband, a spiritual
       leader, etc.?
   27. Do you often complain—about the weather, your health, your
       circumstances, your job, your church?
   28. Do you talk about yourself too much?
   29. Are you more concerned about your problems, needs, burdens than
       about others’ concerns?
   30. Do you worry about what others think of you? Too concerned about
       your reputation or your family’s reputation?
   31. Do you neglect to express gratitude for “little things”? To God? To
       others?
   32. Do you neglect prayer and intake of the Word?
   33. Do you get hurt if your accomplishments/or acts of service are not
       recognized or rewarded?
   34. Do you get hurt if your feelings or opinions are not considered
       when your mate or your boss is making a decision or if you are not
       informed when a change or decision is made?
   35. Do you react to rules? Do you have a hard time being told what to
       do?
   36. Are you self-conscious because of your lack of education or natural
       beauty, or your socio-economic status?
   37. Do you avoid participating in certain events, for fear of being
       embarrassed or looking foolish?
   38. Do you avoid being around certain people because you feel inferior
       compared to them/don’t feel you measure up?
   39. Are you uncomfortable inviting people to your home because you
       don’t think it’s nice enough or you can’t afford to do lavish
       entertaining?
   40. Is it hard for you to let others know when you need help (practical
       or spiritual)?
   41. When is the last time you said these words to a family member,
       friend or coworker: “I was wrong; would you please forgive me?” (If
       it’s been more than a month, mark it down!)

   Are you sitting here thinking how many of these questions apply to
   someone you know? Feeling pretty good that none of these signs of pride
   really apply to you?
