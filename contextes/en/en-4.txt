Pride Month Quotes on LGBTQ+ Pride & Equity

     1. “It is revolutionary for any trans person to choose to be seen
     and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist.”

   – Laverne Cox

     2. “Do not allow people to dim your shine because they are blinded.
     Tell them to put on some sunglasses, because we were born this way.”

   – Lady Gaga

     3. “There will not be a magic day when we wake up and it’s now okay

   – Marsha P. Johnson

     5. “Of course, attitudes change, but only because brave people like
     Ellen [DeGeneres] jump into the fire to make them change. And if I
     hadn’t seen her on TV, I would have thought, ‘I could never be on
     TV. They don’t let LGBT people on TV.’ And more than that, I would
     have gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn’t
     even have a right to be here.”

   – Kate McKinnon

     life.”

   – Lena Waithe

     definition of your life; define yourself.”

   – Harvey Fierstein

   Group of People Marching Group of People Marching

     18. “The more I’ve been able to learn about gay rights and equal pay
     and gender equity and racial inequality, the more that it all
     intersects. You can’t really pick it apart. It’s all intertwined.”

   – Megan Rapinoe

     19. “We cannot be antiracist if we are homophobic or transphobic…
     All Black lives include those of poor transgender Black women,
     perhaps the most violated and oppressed of all the Black
     intersectional groups.”

   – Ibram X. Kendi

     20. “It is important and vital is to keep that education for
     critical consciousness around intersectionalities, so that people
     are able to not focus on one thing and blame one group, but be able
     to look holistically at the way intersectionality informs all of us:
     whiteness, gender, sexual preferences, etc. Only then can we have a
     realistic handle on the political and cultural world we live
     within.”

   – bell hooks

     21. “Gender is between your ears and not between your legs.”

   – Chaz Bono

     22. “Being transgender is not just a medical transition. It’s
     discovering who you are, living your live authentically, loving
     yourself, and spreading that love towards other people and accepting
     one another, no matter the difference.”

   – Jazz Jennings

     23. “We’re all born naked, and the rest is drag.”

   – RuPaul

     24. “It is time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two
     sets of opposing ideals.”

   – Emma Watson

     25. “Gender is not what people look like to other people; it is what
     we know ourselves to be. No one else should be able to tell you who
     you are; that’s for you to decide…Man and woman are two of many –
     stars in a constellation that do not compete but amplify one
     another’s shine.”

   – Alok Vaid-Menon

     your right to grow.”

   – Alice Walker

     27. “Being an ally can’t just be about nodding when someone says
     something we agree with – important as that is. It must also be
     about action. It’s our job to stand up for those who are not at the
     table when life-altering decisions are made.”

   – Kamala Harris

     28. “When we’re free to love anyone we choose, when this world’s big
     enough for all different views, when we all can worship from our own
     kind of pew – then, we shall be free.”

   – Garth Brooks

     29. “…there is a subtle difference between tolerance and acceptance.
     It’s the distance between moving into the cul-de-sac and having your
     next door neighbor trust you to keep an eye on her preschool
     daughter for a few minutes while she runs out to the post office.
     It’s the chasm between being invited to a colleague’s wedding with
     your same-sex partner and being able to slow-dance without the other
     guests whispering.”

   – Jodi Picoult

     30. “We need to own that if you truly are taking stands against hate
     and oppression, you should not fund hate and oppression. Period.”

   – Gabrielle Union

Pride Quotes on Queer Visibility

   Queer Pride March Queer Pride March

     31. “If public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids
     who saw them on TV would feel safe before they even knew why they
     felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay
     kids would never feel dangerous. Maybe we could have a world where
     we could all just live. We may not all agree, but why can’t we just
     all live?”

   – Margaret Cho

     32. “We have to be visible. We should not be ashamed of who we are.”

   – Sylvia Rivera

     33.”The whole issue of sexuality is so grey. I’m just trying to
     acknowledge that fluidity, that greyness, which has always existed.
     But maybe only now are we allowed to start talking about it.”

   – Kristen Stewart

     34. “Love demands expression. It will not stay still, stay silent,
     be good, be modest, be seen and not heard, no. It will break out in
     tongues of praise, the high note that smashes the glass and spills
     the liquid.”

   – Jeanette Winterson

     35. “Each step forwards to become the person we are makes it harder
     to go backwards, to return to the shadowy, private world of closed
     doors and shuttered windows. The experience, the awakening of one’s
     true self, after being so long suppressed, can never be adequately
     explained with language.”

    – Lili Elbe

     36. “When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service
     of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am
     afraid.”

   – Audre Lorde

     37. “If I wait for someone else to validate my existence, it will
     mean that I’m shortchanging myself.”

   – Zanele Muholi

     38. “There’s nothing wrong with you. There’s a lot wrong with the
     world you live in.”

   – Chris Colfer

     39. “This community has fought and continues to fight a war of
     acceptance, a war of tolerance and the most relentless bravery. You

   – Karamo Brown

     or my sexual orientation, or what people assumed of me; and every
     single time my goal has been to combat that and show my greatness.”

   – Taylor Small

     42. “I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the
     more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I
     dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive.”

   – Elliot Page

     43. “Putting yourself out there is hard, but it’s so worth it. I
     don’t think anyone who has ever spoken out, or stood up or had a
     brave moment, has regretted it. It’s empowering and
     confidence-building and inspiring. Not only to other people, but to
     yourself.”

   – Megan Rapinoe

Pride Month Quotes on Changing History

   Quotes on Changing History Quotes on Changing History

     44. “History isn’t something you look back at and say it was
     inevitable. It happens because people make decisions that are
     sometimes very impulsive and of the moment, but those moments are

   – Marsha P. Johnson

     transgender citizen of this country.”

   – Zachary Quinto

     46. “All of us who are openly gay are living and writing the history
     of our movement. We are no more — and no less — heroic than the
     suffragists and abolitionists of the 19th century; and the labor
     organizers, Freedom Riders, Stonewall demonstrators, and
     environmentalists of the 20th century.”

   – Tammy Baldwin

     47. “I believe that telling our stories, first to ourselves and then

   – Audre Lorde

     52. “Never has it felt more important for me to tell stories of joy
     and abandon passion and recklessness. Life is short and difficult,
     people. We must take our pleasures where we can find them. Let us
     not become so cautious that we forget to live.”

   – Elizabeth Gilbert

     53. “When I was younger, I wish I would have been told more often
     that I was right and nothing was wrong with me, that I was deserving
     of everything this world has to offer, and that my visions for my
     future were worthy of pursuit.”

   – Janet Mock

     54. “To be afraid is to behave as if the truth were not true.”

Frequently Asked Questions About Pride Month

   Pride Month FAQ Pride Month FAQ

What is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is a time for the LGBT community and allies to come
   together in celebration, solidarity, activism, reflection, and support
   of all LGBTQIA+ people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
   intersex, and asexual).

   While a Pride Parade or Pride March are often part of Pride
   celebrations, there’s more to this holiday than parades! Pride can be a
   meaningful time to learn about the historical and present struggles and
   exclusion of LGBT people.

When is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is celebrated during the month of June. In 2023, Pride
   Month will be June 1-30, 2023.

Where is Pride Month celebrated?

   Pride Month is primarily celebrated in the United States. However, you
   can find Pride Month festivities around the globe – even in areas where
   it is not an officially recognized occasion.

How did Pride begin?

   Pride originated as a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the
   Stonewall Uprising (sometimes called the Stonewall Riots). In the early
   hours of June 28, 1969, police conducted a raid on a gay bar called the
   Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City.

   Unfortunately, during this time, being gay was a criminal offense. In
   fact, it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person until 1966. Raids
   on gay bars were standard procedure, but this raid would go down in
   history as the birth of the Pride movement.

   Led by courageous transwomen, people at the Stonewall Inn protested the
   raid, leading to a six-day-long resistance. By just the second evening,
   thousands of protestors had gathered. Confrontation, violence, and
   escalation ensued for nearly a week. In the aftermath of Stonewall,
   many people became more engaged in activism and advocating for the
   equal treatment for LGBT people.

   The first Pride march was held one year later, on June 28, 1970.

   Learn more about the Stonewall Uprising from the Library of Congress.
