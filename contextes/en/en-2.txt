     * Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often
       used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride
       relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would
       have others think of us.
       Jane Austen

       ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because

       of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the
       face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

       competition is gone, pride is gone.
