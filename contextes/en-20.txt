   Pride is defined as a feeling of worthiness and, interestingly, it can
   be both detrimental and beneficial to an individual's personality.

   Generally, it is good to be proud of yourself, as having pride in
   yourself will boost your self-esteem and self-worth, and perhaps even
   motivate you to achieve your goals. However, too much pride can be
   negative, remember the famous saying: "pride always comes before a
   fall"?

   Most pride is positive though, such as the pride that parents feel when
   their child graduates from college! So, let's celebrate ourselves and
   embrace being proud with this list of the best pride quotes that define
   this quality in the best possible way.

   For more great quotes, check out these stay humble quotes and vanity
   quotes.

   5. "Pride builds walls between people, humility builds bridges."

   them and thinking we deserve what we have."

   -Joyce Meyer.

   62. "Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having
   more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you
   proud: the pleasure of being above the rest."
