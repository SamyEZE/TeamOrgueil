Frequently Asked Questions About Pride Month

   Pride Month FAQ Pride Month FAQ

What is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is a time for the LGBT community and allies to come
   together in celebration, solidarity, activism, reflection, and support
   of all LGBTQIA+ people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
   intersex, and asexual).

   While a Pride Parade or Pride March are often part of Pride
   celebrations, there’s more to this holiday than parades! Pride can be a
   meaningful time to learn about the historical and present struggles and
   exclusion of LGBT people.

When is Pride Month?

   Pride Month is celebrated during the month of June. In 2023, Pride
   Month will be June 1-30, 2023.

Where is Pride Month celebrated?

   Pride Month is primarily celebrated in the United States. However, you
   can find Pride Month festivities around the globe – even in areas where
   it is not an officially recognized occasion.

How did Pride begin?

   Pride originated as a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the
   Stonewall Uprising (sometimes called the Stonewall Riots). In the early
   hours of June 28, 1969, police conducted a raid on a gay bar called the
   Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City.
--
   Unfortunately, during this time, being gay was a criminal offense. In
   fact, it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person until 1966. Raids
   on gay bars were standard procedure, but this raid would go down in
   history as the birth of the Pride movement.

   Led by courageous transwomen, people at the Stonewall Inn protested the
   raid, leading to a six-day-long resistance. By just the second evening,
--
   many people became more engaged in activism and advocating for the
   equal treatment for LGBT people.

   The first Pride march was held one year later, on June 28, 1970.
