Ambassador Gutmann's Opening Statement for Pride Day Panel 2023

   AMB Gutmann delivering remarks in chancery courtyard Today we have
   invited you all to join us in honoring the contributions of the LGBTQ+
   communities in both Germany and the United States, to celebrate their
   legacy, and to chart an inspiring course — “toward a more perfect
   union” — for the future.  That is what Pride Month is all about –
   taking stock of the past to prepare us for a more inclusive, just, and
   joyful future.

   Speaking of more inclusive, just, and joyful: This year, President
   Biden hosted the largest Pride celebration in White House history with
   LGBTQ+ families from across the country.

   And here at the Embassy and at our five Consulates, the past 12 months
   have been Pride Year.

   Last summer, we rolled out a series of Pride events to promote LGBTQIA+
   rights. We followed up throughout the year with multiple programs
   highlighting what together we are doing in the United States and
   Germany to advance equality for the LGBTQIA+ community both at home and
   abroad.  You have been our partners in these programs, and many more.
   For that, and much more: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

   On his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic Executive
   Order charging the federal government with protecting LGBTQIA+ people
   from discrimination —on everything ranging from health care to housing,
   education to employment, commerce and criminal justice.

   Our country—and every country—is stronger when our leaders reflect our
   full diversity, and when our rights and values are woven into the daily
   work of our government. Toward a more perfect union starts at the White
   House, our Embassy, and all our embassies around the world.

   We have made real progress but we cannot rest content. There is an
   urgency of this moment.  There are those who want to roll back the
   progress so many have fought so hard to achieve.  In the United States,
   we are seeing many very threatening attacks to our most basic values
   and freedoms — from book bans to anti-LGBTQ+ laws to harassment of
   individuals.

   In a third of the world’s countries, queer status or conduct is
   illegal.  In some places, same-sex relationships are criminalized –
   even punishable by death—and people often have no choice but to seek
   refuge elsewhere.  Even in countries of asylum, stigma and abuse are
   far too common.

   Let us be crystal clear: Queer rights are human rights!

   All of our work to promote human rights has real effects. People are
   looking to us. Toward a more perfect union.

   Because both Germany and the United States have played meaningful roles
   in the fight for queer rights, we feel a special and joyful duty to
   celebrate Pride. We will avidly advocate for LGBTQI+ rights as often as
   possible right here at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.

   Let us celebrate the transatlantic struggle for queer rights. Germany
   named its pride celebrations after a street in New York City.
   Christopher Street was the site of a despicable police raid and the
   courage to resist that oppression – and persist. Stonewall was a
   milestone in the American civil rights movement and it launched a
   global movement.

   Let us also recognize the pioneering work of Magnus Hirschfeld at the
   Institute for Sexual Science, established here in Berlin in 1919.
   Magnus’s trailblazing research was lost to the brutality of the Nazi
   regime, but the spark of his idea that queer people deserved rights and
   support could not be extinguished.

   Both these moments in history—one American, one German—show why “toward
   a more perfect union” can never be taken for granted.  This coming
   Saturday, we will be riding and marching – proudly– alongside our
   partners from the Auswärtiges Amt and other Embassies. We are marching
   across Germany – in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Rostock, Leipzig, Muenster, and
   Munich.

   We will never kid ourselves: defending hard-won rights in the face of
   ongoing discrimination is serious work.

   This evening, we could not be prouder than to continue our tradition of
   Pride programs in welcoming Germany’s anti-discrimination commissioner,
   Ferda Ataman.

   We know that history doesn’t just travel forward.  Advancing the gains
   our countries have made requires continual hard work, what I call
   “eternal vigilance.”

   In conclusion, let me say that we will stand proudly for the human
   rights of all people, everywhere. Let me propose a heartfelt toast: To
   a more LGBTQ plus perfect world!

     Amazing night celebrating #PrideMonth at the @usbotschaft with
     LGBTQIA+ friends. Let us be crystal clear: Queer rights are human
     rights! pic.twitter.com/mpiovdARd7

   FAQs
   My name in the visa does not show a transliterated German "Umlaut". Do
   I need to have the visa corrected?
   No. Umlaute” in German names are not transliterated. The letter “ä”
   will be shown as “a”, not “ae”, the letter “ö” as “o” etc.
   I have a visa - Can I travel?
   Information on visa validity and what the visa expiration date means is
   available at
   http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/visa-expiration-d
   ate.html.
   How do I determine which visa category I should apply for? Can the U.S.
   Consular Section tell me which visa I should apply for?
   Information on visa categories is provided on our visa directory page.
   Visa processing begins when the application is received on the
   appointment day. We are unable to make any related decisions before an
   application is received. We are also not authorized to speculate about
   the result of a visa application an applicant is preparing.
   Performers, Entertainers and Athletes
   Information on O- and P visas for performers, entertainers and athletes
   is available on our visa directory page. If you are not sure whether
   you need an O or P visa, send us a short description of the planned
   activities.
   I was told that my visa application needs additional administrative
   processing. What does that mean and how long will it take?
   Under current U.S. law and regulations certain applicants require
   additional administrative processing before a visa can be issued. The
   amount of time required to carry out this additional administrative
   processing varies. It can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to
   several months or longer. We are unable to expedite this process.
   My child has a “Kinderreisepass” and needs a visa urgently, can you
   help me?
   While we can process urgent visa applications, we encourage all
   travelers, children and babies included, to obtain an E-passport. An
   expedited E-passport can be obtained more quickly (within 72 hours) and
   at less cost than a U.S. visa. Please contact your local passport
   office immediately about this option. Should you choose to apply for a
   visa for your child, you can drop off or mail in his or her application
   and all the required documents if the child is under 14 years of age.
   If the child is 14 or older, an appointment and a personal appearance
   are necessary. However, you should be aware of the fact that it takes
   2-3 days for the visa application to be processed and the visa to be
   issued, and then it will be mailed to you via the German postal system.
   We cannot guarantee any specific date when the visa will be ready.
