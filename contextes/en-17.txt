   Pride and Prejudice is the second novel by English author Jane Austen,
   published in 1813. A novel of manners, it follows the character
   development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who
   learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to
--
   of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a
   motivation that drives the plot.

   Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of
   "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. It
   has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with
   over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in
   modern literature.^[1]^[2] For more than a century, dramatic
   adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of
   Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes
   of the novel, reaching mass audiences.^[3]

Plot summary[edit]

   handsome enough to tempt him" to dance. (Artist: C.E. Brock, 1895)

   In the early 19th century, the Bennet family live at their Longbourn

   heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise
   her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr Darcy grows as she
   suspects he was responsible for Mr Bingley's departure.

   Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia
   and Wickham, in one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and
   Prejudice.^[4] The clothing styles reflect the time the illustration
   was engraved (the 1830s), not the time in which the novel was written

       tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story
       progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of
       Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy
       overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading
       them both to surrender to their love for each other.
     * Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy – Mr Bingley's friend and the wealthy owner of
       the family estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, rumoured to be worth
       at least £10,000 a year. While he is handsome, tall, and
       intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and social graces, and so others
       frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof of
       excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the novel,
       he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest. Though he
       appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this
       reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.

Major themes[edit]

   Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of
   Pride and Prejudice but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much
   into the title (which was initially First Impressions), because
   commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. "After the
   success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more
--
   the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

   The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the
   other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and
   prejudice."^[9] The phrase "pride and prejudice" had been used over the
   preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison
   and Samuel Johnson.^[10]^[11] Austen probably took her title from a
   passage in Fanny Burney's Cecilia (1782), a popular novel she is known
   to have admired:

     "The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been
     the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. […] if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you
     owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to
     PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination."^[11]^[12]
     (capitalisation as in the original)

   A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and
--
   Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world
   and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr and Mrs Bennet as parents is
   blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be
   principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and
   overbearing.^[13] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and
--
   The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an
   edition of Austen's novel in 1995:

     Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels
     consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that
     teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room
     making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the

   C. E. Brock,
   1895[220px-Pickering_-_Greatbatch_-_Jane_Austen_-_Pride_and_Prejudice_-
   _This_is_not_to_be_borne%2C_Miss_Bennet.jpg] Lady Catherine confronts
   Elizabeth about Darcy, on the title page of the first illustrated
   edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.

   Austen might be known now for her "romances" but the marriages in her
   novels engage with economics and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice
   is hardly the exception.

   When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social

   Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them.
   Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:

     "How despicably have I acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself
     on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who
     have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and
     gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How

Style[edit]

   Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative
   technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as "the free
   representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words
   actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the

   Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first
   mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First
   Impressions. (NLA)

   Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in
--
   to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it
   is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.^[36]

   She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when
   she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for
   £110^[37] (equivalent to £7,800 in 2021). In renaming the novel, Austen
   probably had in mind the "sufferings and oppositions" summarised in the
   final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called "Pride and Prejudice",
   where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.^[13]

   It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid
   confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of
   First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other
   works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford
   and a comedy by Horace Smith.^[34]

Publication history[edit]

   [220px-Brock_Pride_and_Prejudice.jpg] Title page of a 1907 edition
   illustrated by C. E. Brock

   Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the
--
   subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the
   book.^[39]

   Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three
   hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.^[40] It was advertised in The
   Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.^[33] Favourable reviews saw this
   edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year.
--

   Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French;
   subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and
   Swedish.^[41] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United
   States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.^[38]
   The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series
   in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice,
   first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many
   modern published versions of the novel are based.^[38]

   The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's
   novels. However, whereas her first published novel, Sense and
   Sensibility was presented as being written "by a Lady," Pride and
   Prejudice was attributed to "the Author of Sense and Sensibility". This
   began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit
   anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the
--
   months following publication.^[39] Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be
   the wife of Lord Byron, called it "the fashionable novel".^[39] Noted
   critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he "would rather
   have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the
   Waverley Novels".^[42]

   Charlotte Brontë, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and
   Prejudice was a disappointment, "a carefully fenced, highly cultivated
   garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open
   country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck".^[42]^[43]

   Austen for her part thought the "playfulness and epigrammaticism" of
   Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her
   sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked "shade" and should have
   had a chapter "of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected
   with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the
   history of Buonaparté".^[44]

   Walter Scott wrote in his journal, "Read again and for the third time
   at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and
   Prejudice."^[45]

20th century[edit]
--

   The American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the
   criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.^[46] One
   critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the "romantic conclusion" of Pride and
   Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the
   "individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and
   the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic
--
   wrote the "outrageous unconventionality" of Elizabeth Bennet was in
   Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship
   that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the
   1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.^[46]

21st century[edit]

     * In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the "UK's Best-Loved Book" in
       which Pride and Prejudice came second, behind The Lord of the
       Rings.^[47]
     * In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and
       Prejudice came first in a list of the 101 best books ever
       written.^[48]
     * The 200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice on 28 January 2013 was
       celebrated around the globe by media networks such as the
       Huffington Post, The New York Times, and The Daily Telegraph, among
       others.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

   Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in
   concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell
   as Darcy.^[61] The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera
   Stolthet och fördom on Pride and Prejudice.^[62] Works inspired by the
   book include Bride and Prejudice and Trishna (1985 Hindi TV series).

   Fire Island is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines
   Pride and Prejudice as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay
   vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie "as an
   unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen's Pride and
   Prejudice."^[70] The movie was released in June 2022 and features a
   main cast of Asian-American actors.
