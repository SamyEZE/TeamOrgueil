الكبرياء الذكورية السياسية

   Apr 10, 2018 [38]Ian Buruma

   نيويورك ـ تشهد العديد من البلدان في العالماليوم ثورات من الذكورة
   المفرطة. يقدم رئيس الولايات المتحدة نفسه على أنه نوع من رجال الكهوف،
   الذين يضربون على صدرهم، ويعتدون على النساء، ويصدرون زئيرا مثل القرود
   الضخمة. وقد تمكن جوردن بيترسون أستاذ علم النفس الكندي، من جذب عدد لا
   يحصى من الشباب الذكور، حين أخبرهم أنه عليهم الوقوف بشكل مستقيم، ومحاربة
   الليونة الليبرالية، وإعادة تأكيد سلطة الذكور، واستعادة التسلسلات
   الهرمية الاجتماعية القديمة الذي يعتقد أنها قوى الطبيعة. يعد بيترسون
   أكثر خلقا من جورو بلان، وهو خبير آخر في مجال المساعدة الذاتية للذكور،
   والذي تسبب في فضيحة قبل بضع سنوات بقوله إن النساء يستمتعن بالتعرض
   للعنف.

   وقد حدثت مثل هذه الثورات من قبل بطريقة سياسية سيئة. في إيطاليا بين
   الحربين العالميتين، جعل موسوليني نفسه محورًا للعبادة الذكورية: القائد
   الفاشي العظيم المتذمر والمتعجرف، الذي يرتدي أحذية ركوب الخيل، ويثبت
   يديه على حزامه الجلدي، مستعرضا فكّه الكبير، والذي كان يسيطر على
   إيطاليا، كما لو كانت عشيقته المطيعة.

   يحذو قادة فاشيون آخرون في أوروبا حذو موسوليني. فبعد أن انتابهم شعور
   بالانحطاط الوطني، ونمو الثقافات الناعمة، سعوا إلى إحياء شعوبهم من خلال
   إقامة عروض الرجولة المسرحية. وقد أوضح وصف هتلر للشباب المثل الرجولي
   التالي: "سريعين مثل كلاب الصيد، أقوياء كالجلد، وصارمين مثل الصلب".

       is this supposed to be an informed comment? It is a meandering,
       purposeless, incoherent rant. Both the website and the author, when
       sober, must be embarrassed about this.

       One could have found millions of cases of machismo not simply in
       Mao's era but also in Chiang Kaishek's time, but not a single case
       is reported here. Confucianist culture is machismo itself. Ralph
       Townsend/Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China tells one what
       sort of culture it has been for thousands of years.
       "In 1938 thousands of Jewish refugees, first from Germany and later
       from German-occupied territories in Eastern Europe, started
       arriving in East Asia. The (Japanese) Kwantung Army allowed the
       refugees to settle in Manchuria despite the protests from the
       German Ambassador to Japan, General Eugen Otto... (Japanese)
       Major-General Higuchi Kiichiro, Commander of the Kwantung Army's
       Special Branch, replied that since the refugees had been expelled
       from Germany, the Germans had no authority over them. He added that
       Japan did not belong to Germany and Manchuria did not belong to
       Japan, and therefore the Empire of Manchuokuo was free to admit
       whomever she wished. This blunt answer...was endorsed by Tojo
       Hideki (later War Minister and Prime Minister) (from Ben-Ami
       Shillony, ibid.)"
       "From 1938 until the outbreak of the Pacific War, about 17,000
       Jewish refugees from central and eastern Europe settled in
       Shanghai, mainly in the Japanese controlled section of the
       International Settlement, Hongkew, where housing was cheapest. Most
       of them were poor and jobless and they were helped by the American
       Joint Distribution Committee. The finacial assistance from the US,
       coming through neutral countries, was allowed to continue even
       after the outbreak of the Pacific War (Shillony, ibid.)"

       Consider the following quote
       "Peterson is a slightly more couth version of another male
       self-help guru, Julien Blanc, who caused a scandal a few years ago
       by stating that women enjoy being taken by force."
       At this point, Trump is a model of rational clarity compared with
       Buruma. Don't believe me? Watch a few Jordan Peterson videos. Judge
       for yourself who is crazy. Peterson or Buruma?

       What seems "natural" is for males to use their larger bodies (or
       socially approved egos) to dump on people they perceive to be
       weaker/smaller or . . . dangerous to their power! It's apparently
       just how dominant males have shaped the world, and it's tiresome,
       at best.

       While this hyper masculine, racist right wing culture is almost
       certainly an evil of the world, it exists opposite another kind of
       evil that seeks to reduce each person to nothing less than a
       faceless consumer who value to society is represented my his
       contribution to GDP, making him something akin to cattle.

       Europe has real problems...
       "'Girls must be saved from going through this hell': Call for
       public inquiry into Telford sex scandal as it emerges up to 1,000
       children as young as 11 were drugged, beaten and raped over 40
       years"
       Of course, Buruma would have us believe that the real problem is
       "toxic masculinity". Rhetoric about "toxic masculinity" should be
       seen for what it is, a cloaking device for ideas and policies that
       have wildly enriched the elite while destroying the people of
       Europe.
       But not to worry, the daughters of Buruma's class aren't being
       kidnapped by grooming gangs with the help of the police.

       Hyper masculinity may be fake, or even sometimes ridiculous. But
       the question is: can sissyfication be the future of the western
       world? If this is the case, then indeed it will be the end of the
       white race, which will replaced by another one, doesn't matter
       whether it is black, or yellow, or what ever, provided that il will
       be able to breed, and therefore will care for, not hyper
       masculinity, but just normal masculinity, and normal feminity also,
       even with a good deal of toleration for gay and lesbian
       excentricities.

       Ian Buruma is leading member of the class that is destroying
       Europe. Naturally the people of Europe (and the USA) are fighting
       back. Rather than admitting his one-sided war on the people, we
       have rhetoric about "toxic masculinity". See below for what Buruma
       and his ilk are really up to.
       Quote from a French analyst (Guilluy)
       "the rhetoric of an “open society” is “a smokescreen meant to hide
       the emergence of a closed society, walled off for the benefit of
       the upper classes.”"
       That's what "Open Europe" is really all about. Destroying the lives
       of the people of Europe so the elite can profit economically and
       engage in "virtue signaling" while suffering none of the
       consequences of Open Borders, mass immigration, invasion, etc.

       The idea that hyper-masculinity is breaking out around the world is
       absurd. The reverse is far closer to the truth. Anyone with the
       slightest knowledge of #metoo knows how far off Buruma really is.
       His attack on Jordan Peterson is particularly appalling. If anyone
       wants to know the truth of this, just watch a few Jordan Peterson
       videos. Judge for yourself is Buruma is credible or not.

       It has been obvious to most unbiased readers of history of nations
       and civilizations that there exist on opposite sides manifestations
       of - compassion and civillization and brutality and horror. Are
       Japanese different?
       During the II World war how is it Japanese soldiers descended to
       such ghastly levels of barbarism of practicing bayonet practice on
       live POWs- Indian, Chinese, Sikhs, British and Asian women. Yet,
       even after a lapse of 70 years, no apologies or modification of
       Japanese history books!

            Lewis Bush, a British soldier, was captured by Japanese as
            soon as the war broke out. He was detained in Japan until
            Japan's defeat. His experience, clutch of circumstance, is

            end is considerably big, but the difference or divide in shool
            history books is very small.

            About a half of the Japanese people were men. I do not deny
            atrocities by Japanese. There was and is machismo. I sent a
            postscript or a reply to my first comment below.
            As for the Japanese "apoligies not yet", will you read my
            comment on Pro-Syn/Emily Chen/The Surrender of Japan's Peace
            Constitution.
            As for the modification of Japanese school textbooks, I
            support it or I am for it. It is a long story to tell and
            Japanese politics is deeply involved in it or in a rather deep
            political divide. More than fifteen years ago a group of
            people from Stanford Universtity compared school history
            textbooks of Japan, Taiwan, China, South Korea and the United
            States. They gave the Japanese the highest approval rating.
            Unlike in China and South Korea, though I do not know about
            the Taiwanese case, Japanese scholars and experts have rather
            ample freedom in editing and writing school books within a
            mildly limited guidance prescribed by the Ministry of
            Education and and private publishing companies can print them
            of their choice, and local educational boards can pick out
            ones of their choice for junior high school; each senior high
            school picks out the one that it likes to use. The one of my
            liking is harldy adopted; when a high school or a town or city
            educational board selects it, they will have to meet a
            negatively sensatinalized mass media report.

       "The grotesque form of Japanese militarism in the 1930s" may be
       grotesque, but it was far below an international par; it was very
       kawaii (かわいい, cute) if compared to the international standard.
       Ben-Amy Shillony, Politics and Culture in Wartime Japan is a very
       good introduction and tells what sort of militarism it was if any.
       An American said Japanese military songs sounded like funeral
       songs. Yes, they do. Takeo Doi, The Anatomy of Dependence does not
       particularly deal with the 1930s Japan but tells some aspects of
       Japanese cultural femininity.
       Donald Keene introduced Japanese literature to the world. His first
       contact with Japan was through Arther Waley's translation of The
       Tales of Genji. It was the world's first long novel written by a
       woman. Keene says the Tales are stories of Japanese aristocracy of
       the Heian Period (794~1185), but that, unlike other aristocratic
       stories which are full of violence and blood, there is none like
       that. Death sentence as a formal penalty was in abeyance during the
       Heian.
       Herbert Passin says in his Encounter with Japan, very contrary to
       when he speaks Spanish, "When I speak Japanese, I am always
       surprised at what a polite person I can be, something that I do not
       particularly think about myself when I speak English."
       I appreciate Prof. Buruma's interest in Japan very much, but I do
       not know whether good understanding or misunderstanding of Japan is
       being disseminated.

            PS. Prof. Buruma's grotesque Japanese militarism wanted to
            withdraw from China and avoid war with the United States; it
            was the FDR administration that wanted war in the Pacific as a
            doorway to the European war with Hitler. Eighty years are
            going to pass soon and it is time that the professor should
            know the truth. Japan should be absolved of the crime or
            crimes it did not commit. I should be grateful if he could
            read my (Michi's) comments on Hamilton Fish/FDR, the other
            side of the coin: How we were tricked into World War II and
            Charles Beard/Presiden Roosevelt and the Coming of the War,
            1941: Appearances and Realities, amazon usa. I understand
            President Hoover's Freedom Betrayed holds the same view.
            "Despite the barrage of anti-American rhetoric, it was not
            easy to persuade the public to hate the Americans. The
            Japanese had been taught for years to admire the US and
            Britain for their techonological and cultural achievements,
            and it was impossible to change these feelings at one stroke
            (Ben-Amy Shillony, Politics and Culture In Wartime Japan."
            A Japanese lady saw American prisoners of war being led in the
            street and exclaimed, "Okawisoni (poor fellows)," and she was
            rebuked.
            "Postwar film critics have observed that American and British
            characters in wartime Japanese movies were portrayed as human
            beings, in marked contrast to the squat and lustful yellow
            dwarfs who represented Japanese characters in American films
            of that time (Ben-Amy Shillony, ibid)."
            No prisoners of war were lynched after the Hiroshima and
            Nagasaki, nowhere in Japan, except an American soldier,
            presumably Atkinson, who had already been dead in the
            Hiroshima bomb, etc.
            Japanese soldiers raped Chinese women and then pierced them in
            the womb with sticks. Perhaps a gigantic lie fondly told and
            spread by Chinese; the truth is that it was the traditional
            art perpetrated by Chinese. If interested, please read my
            (Michi's) comment, American Humanism, on Chinese Comfort
            Women, amazon usa.
            "...these pro-Western feelings, which could not be erased,
            were soon to surface from the ashes of defeat (Shillony,
            ibid)."

                 Ah yes, Japan was tricked into bombing Pearl Harbor,
                 invading China, Indochina and the Philippines.
                 Were their opponents shaking snacks and softly calling,
                 "Here kitty, kitty, kitty"?
                 Absolving aggressors of their aggression is about as

                      "The attempt to transfer the traditional admiration
                      for Britain and the United States to Nazi Germany
                      did not succeed, because respect for the West could

                      overreaction to the real or imaginary dangers of
                      those years (Politics And Culture In Wartime Japan)"

                           Japan did not start the war from a noble motive
                           of liberating Asian countries from the West but
                           a selfishi one; the liberation was an
                           unintended by-product.
                           I understand if I remember correctly, and
                           correct me if I am wrong, that about two
                           hundred and fifty or at least less than three
                           hundred Germans were sentenced to death after
                           the war but about one thousand Japanese were.

[124]Market Power Is Permanent, and Technological Competition Does Not Remove
It
       [125]Mordecai Kurz
       Rather than reducing concentrated market power through “disruption”
       or “creative destruction,” technological innovation historically
       has only added to the problem, by awarding monopolies to just one
       or a few dominant firms. And market forces offer no remedy to the
       problem; only public policy can provide that.
       shows that technological change leads not to disruption, but to
       deeper, more enduring forms of market power.

       The passing of America’s preeminent foreign-policy thinker and
       practitioner marks the end of an era. Throughout his long and
       extraordinarily influential career, Henry Kissinger built a legacy
       that Americans would be wise to heed in this new era of great-power
       politics and global disarray.
       reviews the life and career of America’s preeminent foreign-policy
       scholar-practitioner.
