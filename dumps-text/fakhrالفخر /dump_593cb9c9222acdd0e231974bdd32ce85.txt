إحياء شهر الفخر لمجتمع الميم عين

   ترجمات باللغة العربية

   1 حزيران/يونيو 2023

   وزارة الخارجية الأمريكية
   مكتب المتحدث باسم وزارة الخارجية
   بيان لوزير الخارجية أنتوني ج. بلينكن
   1 حزيران/يونيو 2023

   تحتفل الولايات المتحدة في شهر حزيران/يونيو من كل سنة بشهر الفخر الذي
   يحيي ذكرى انتفاضة ستونوول، عندما داهمت الشرطة حانة للمثليين في مدينة
   نيويورك فانتفض أصحابها ضد التمييز وعمليات الإيذاء وسوء المعاملة. يذكرنا
   شهر الفخر بروحية التظاهر الديمقراطي والمبدأ القائل إن كافة الأشخاص قد
   خلقوا سواسية وينبغي احترام الإنسانية الكاملة لكل فرد بشكل متساو.

   بتنا نعرف اليوم وبعد مرور خمسة عقود على انتفاضة ستونوول أن إشمال أفراد
   مجتمع الميم عين (المثليات والمثليين ومزدوجي الميول الجنسية والعابرين
   جنسيا والمثليين ذوي الميول الخاصة والمتحولين جنسيا) واحترامهم يقوي
   أمتنا، كما ندرك تأثير الأفراد والمنظمات التابعة لمجتمع الميم عين على
   بعض من أحجار زاوية ديمقراطيتنا، بما في ذلك من خلال السعي وراء الحقيقة
   من خلال وسائل إعلام حرة وممارسة الحق في التجمع السلمي.

   تعمل وزارة الخارجية بفخر لتعزيز حقوق الإنسان الخاصة بأفراد مجتمع العين
   ميم في مختلف أنحاء العالم وحمايتها، كما نعارض بشدة جعل أفراد مجتمع
   العين ميم “يبدون مختلفين” لتبرير عمليات الاستيلاء على السلطة بشكل
   استبدادي ومهاجمة المؤسسات الديمقراطية في مختلف أنحاء العالم،
   فالديمقراطية تكتسب قوة عند احتفائها بكامل حقوق كافة الأشخاص وقيمتهم
   بدون تمييز.
