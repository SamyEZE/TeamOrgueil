   Pride and Prejudice is the second novel by English author [158]Jane
   Austen, published in 1813. A [159]novel of manners, it follows the
   character development of [160]Elizabeth Bennet, the [161]protagonist of
   the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and
   comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and
   actual goodness.

   Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in [162]Hertfordshire, has
   five daughters, but his property is [163]entailed and can only be
   passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his
   family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that
   at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which
   is a motivation that drives the plot.

   Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of
   "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. It
   has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with
   over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in
   modern literature.^[164][1]^[165][2] For more than a century, dramatic
   adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of
   Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes
   of the novel, reaching mass audiences.^[166][3]

Plot summary[[167]edit]

   [168][220px-PrideandPrejudiceCH3.jpg] Mr Darcy says Elizabeth is "not
   handsome enough to tempt him" to dance. (Artist: [169]C.E. Brock, 1895)

   In the early 19th century, the [170]Bennet family live at their
   Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton in
   [171]Hertfordshire, England. Mrs Bennet's greatest desire is to marry
   off her five daughters to secure their futures.

   The arrival of Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring
   Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might
   contract an advantageous marriage, because "It is a truth universally
   acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must
   be in want of a wife".

   At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including
   Mr Bingley, his two sisters and [172]Mr Darcy, his dearest friend. Mr
   Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the
   guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr
   Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr Bingley, is haughty and
   aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with
   [173]Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is "not
   handsome enough". Although she jokes about it with her friend,
   Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr Darcy
   secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to
   encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and
   frankness.

   [174]Mr Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet
   family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under
   the advice of his patroness [175]Lady Catherine de Bourgh, also
   revealed to be Mr Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The
   Bennet family meet the charming army officer [176]George Wickham, who
   tells Elizabeth in confidence about Mr Darcy's unpleasant treatment of
   him in the past. Elizabeth, blinded by her prejudice toward Mr Darcy,
   believes him.

   Elizabeth dances with Mr Darcy at a ball, where Mrs Bennet hints loudly
   that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects
   Mr Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's
   relief. Mr Collins instead proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of
   Elizabeth.

   Having heard Mrs Bennet's words at the ball and disapproving of the
   marriage, Mr Darcy joins Mr Bingley in a trip to London and, with the
   help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A
   heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise
   her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr Darcy grows as she
   suspects he was responsible for Mr Bingley's departure.
   [177][220px-Pickering_-_Greatbatch_-_Jane_Austen_-_Pride_and_Prejudice_
   -_She_then_told_him_what_Mr._Darcy_had_voluntarily_done_for_Lydia.jpg]
   Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia
   and Wickham, in one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and
   Prejudice.^[178][4] The clothing styles reflect the time the
   illustration was engraved (the 1830s), not the time in which the novel
   was written or set.

   In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in [179]Kent.
   Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's
   home. Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting
   Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy recently saved a
   friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth
   realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane.

   Mr Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her
   low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr
   Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last
   person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who
   caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating
   Wickham unjustly. Mr Darcy brags about his success in separating
   Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding
   Wickham without addressing it.

   The next day, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that
   Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the
   "[180]living" his father had arranged for him and was instead given
   money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope
   with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable
   [181]dowry. Mr Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley
   because he believed her indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack
   of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her
   family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr Darcy.

   Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of
   [182]Derbyshire. They visit [183]Pemberley, Darcy's estate. When Mr
   Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth
   and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and
   grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She
   receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells
   Mr Darcy, then departs in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham
   agrees to marry Lydia. She visits the family and tells Elizabeth that
   Mr Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr Darcy had sworn everyone
   involved to secrecy, Mrs Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth
   that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

   Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr
   Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth
   intends to marry Mr Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to
   accept Mr Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already
   planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks
   the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's
   indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and
   is accepted.

   Thomson, 1894
     * [191]Elizabeth Bennet – the second-eldest of the Bennet daughters,
       she is attractive, witty and intelligent – but with a tendency to
       form tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story
       progresses, so does her relationship with Mr Darcy. The course of
       Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy
       overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading
       them both to surrender to their love for each other.
     * [192]Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy – Mr Bingley's friend and the wealthy
       owner of the family estate of [193]Pemberley in Derbyshire,
       rumoured to be worth at least £10,000 a year. While he is handsome,
       tall, and intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and [194]social graces, and
       so others frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof
       of excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the
       novel, he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest. Though he
       appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this
       reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.
     * [195]Mr Bennet – A logical and reasonable late-middle-aged
       [196]landed gentleman of a more modest income of £2,000 per annum,
       and the dryly sarcastic patriarch of the now-dwindling [197]Bennet
       family, with five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, is
       [198]entailed to the male line. His affection for his wife wore off
       early in their marriage and is now reduced to mere toleration. He
       is often described as 'indolent' in the novel.
     * [199]Mrs Bennet ([200]née Gardiner) – the middle-aged wife of Mr
       Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters. Mrs Bennet is a
       [201]hypochondriac who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of
       tremors and palpitations (her "poor nerves") whenever things are
       not going her way. Her main ambition in life is to marry her
       daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will
       give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her. She was
       settled a [202]dowry of £4,000 from her father.

   [203][220px-William_Blake_Mrs_Q_1820_engraving_after_Francois_Huet_Vill
   iers_The_British_Museum.jpg] In a letter to Cassandra dated May 1813,
   Jane Austen describes a picture she saw at a gallery which was a good
   likeness of "Mrs Bingley" – Jane Bennet. Deirdre Le Faye in The World
   of Her Novels suggests that "Portrait of Mrs Q" is the picture Austen
   was referring to. (pp. 201–203)
     * [204]Jane Bennet – the eldest Bennet sister. She is considered the
       most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is inclined to
       see only the good in others (but can be persuaded otherwise on
       sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a
       rich young gentleman recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close
       friend of Mr Darcy.
     * [205]Mary Bennet – the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of
       her siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and
       plays music, although she is often impatient to display her
       accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently
       moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's
       [206]A Memoir of Jane Austen, Mary ended up marrying one of her
       Uncle Philips' law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.
     * [207]Catherine "Kitty" Bennet – the fourth Bennet daughter. Though
       older than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit
       of the officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious
       of Lydia and is described as a "silly" young woman. However, it is
       said that she improved when removed from Lydia's influence.
       According to James Edward Austen-Leigh's A Memoir of Jane Austen,
       Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.
     * [208]Lydia Bennet – the youngest Bennet sister. She is frivolous
       and headstrong. Her main activity in life is socialising,
       especially flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to
       her running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention
       of marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her
       society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she "feels without
       reasoning".^[209][5]

     * Charles Bingley – a handsome, amiable, wealthy young gentleman from
       the north of England, who leases Netherfield Park, an estate three
       miles from Longbourn, with the hopes of purchasing it. He is
       contrasted with Mr Darcy for having more generally pleasing
       manners, although he is reliant on his more experienced friend for
       advice. An example of this is the prevention of Bingley and Jane's
       romance because of Bingley's undeniable dependence on Darcy's
       opinion.^[210][6] He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by
       others; his two sisters, Miss Caroline Bingley and Mrs Louisa
       Hurst, both disapprove of Bingley's growing affection for Miss Jane
       Bennet. He inherited a fortune of £100,000.^[211][7]

     * Caroline Bingley – the vainglorious, snobbish sister of Charles
       Bingley, with a fortune of £20,000. Miss Bingley harbours designs
       upon Mr Darcy, and therefore is jealous of his growing attachment
       to Elizabeth. She attempts to dissuade Mr Darcy from liking
       Elizabeth by ridiculing the Bennet family and criticising
       Elizabeth's comportment. Miss Bingley also disapproves of her
       brother's esteem for Jane Bennet, and is disdainful of society in
       Meryton. Her wealth and her expensive education seem to be the two
       greatest sources of Miss Bingley's vanity and conceit; likewise,
       she is very insecure about the fact that her and her family's money
       all comes from trade, and is eager both for her brother to purchase
       an estate, elevating the Bingleys to the ranks of the gentry, and
       for herself to marry a landed gentleman. The dynamic between Miss
       Bingley and her sister, Louisa Hurst, seems to echo that of Lydia
       and Kitty Bennet, and of Mrs Bennet and Mrs Phillips, in that one
       sister of the pair is no more than a follower of the other:
       Caroline occupies the same position as Lydia does with Kitty, and
       Louisa the same position as Mrs Bennet with Mrs Phillips (though,
       in Louisa's case, as she is already married, she is not under the
       same pressure as Caroline). Louisa is married to Mr Hurst, who has
       a house in [212]Grosvenor Square, London.
     * [213]George Wickham – Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy
       since infancy, being the son of Mr Darcy's father's steward. An
       officer in the militia, he is superficially charming and rapidly
       forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with
       Lydia with no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in
       her and her family's complete disgrace, but for Darcy's
       intervention to bribe Wickham to marry her by paying off his
       immediate debts.
     * [214]Mr William Collins – Mr Collins is Mr Bennet's distant second
       cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate
       of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man, prone to
       making long and tedious speeches, who is excessively devoted to his
       patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
     * [215]Lady Catherine de Bourgh – the overbearing aunt of Mr Darcy.
       Lady Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she
       resides with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr
       Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending,
       and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy, to
       'unite their two great estates', claiming it to be the dearest wish
       of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (née Fitzwilliam).
     * Mr Edward Gardiner and Mrs Gardiner – Edward Gardiner is Mrs
       Bennet's brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and
       gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant and is
       close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are the
       parents of four children. They are instrumental in bringing about
       the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.

     * Georgiana Darcy – Georgiana is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable and shy
       younger sister, with a dowry of £30,000, and is aged barely 16 when
       the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr
       Wickham but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to
       years of tutelage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano,
       singing, playing the harp, drawing, and modern languages and is
       therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an "accomplished
       woman".

     * Charlotte Lucas – Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years
       old (and thus beyond what was then considered prime marriageable
       age), fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore readily
       agrees to marry Mr Collins to gain financial security, having
       seized the opportunity to claim his attentions after Elizabeth
       turns down his proposal. Though the novel stresses the importance
       of love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to
       condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for security. She uses
       Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's
       expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but
       convenience.^[216][8] Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William
       Lucas and Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.
     * Colonel Fitzwilliam – Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an
       earl and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne
       Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy
       siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at
       the beginning of the novel. He is the coguardian of Miss Georgiana
       Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr Darcy. According to Colonel
       Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to
       his prospective bride's dowry.

Major themes[[217]edit]

   Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of
   Pride and Prejudice but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much
   into the title (which was initially First Impressions), because
   commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. "After the
   success of [218]Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more
   natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again
   the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.

   The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the
   other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and
   prejudice."^[219][9] The phrase "pride and prejudice" had been used
   over the preceding two centuries by [220]Joseph Hall, [221]Jeremy
   Taylor, [222]Joseph Addison and [223]Samuel
   Johnson.^[224][10]^[225][11] Austen probably took her title from a
   passage in [226]Fanny Burney's [227]Cecilia (1782), a popular novel she
   is known to have admired:

     "The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been
     the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. […] if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you
     owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to
     PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their
     termination."^[228][11]^[229][12] (capitalisation as in the
     original)

   A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and
   upbringing in developing young people's character and
   morality.^[230][13]

   Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world
   and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr and Mrs Bennet as parents is
   blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be
   principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and
   overbearing.^[231][13] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and
   spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to
   improve greatly in their superior society.^[232][14]

   The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an
   edition of Austen's novel in 1995:

     Pride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels
     consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that
     teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the [233]drawing
     room making [234]small talk as in the pursuit of a [235]great white
     whale or the [236]public punishment of adultery.^[237][15]

Marriage[[238]edit]

   The opening line of the novel famously announces: "It is a truth
   universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good
   fortune must be in want of a wife."^[239][16] This sets marriage as a
   [240]motif and a problem in the novel. Readers are poised to question
   whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated
   by the "neighbourhood" families and their daughters who require a "good
   fortune".

   Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political and
   financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the
   seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial
   circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr and
   Mrs Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial
   attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological).

   The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia,
   re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous.
   Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel
   as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work
   toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees
   them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of
   the real differences in their technically-equivalent social status as
   gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a
   better understanding of each other's point of view from the different
   ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.

   When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying
   for love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when
   she is certain she loves him and her feelings are
   reciprocated.^[241][17] Austen's complex sketching of different
   marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance
   are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual,
   companionate attraction.^[242][18]

Wealth[[243]edit]

   Money plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young
   ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman
   of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and
   Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.

   Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a
   higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters
   to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs Bennet is
   frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of
   high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr Bingley arrives, she declares
   "I am thinking of his marrying one of them".^[244][19]

   Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by
   [245]entailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted
   inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr
   Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr Bennet's death in the
   absence of any closer male heirs, and his proposal to Elizabeth would
   have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer.

   Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have
   independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For
   the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a
   reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and
   the children she was to have.^[246][20] The irony of the opening line
   is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be
   looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.^[247][21]

Class[[248]edit]

   Elizabeth by [250]C. E. Brock,
   1895[251][220px-Pickering_-_Greatbatch_-_Jane_Austen_-_Pride_and_Prejud
   ice_-_This_is_not_to_be_borne%2C_Miss_Bennet.jpg] Lady Catherine
   confronts Elizabeth about [252]Darcy, on the title page of the first
   illustrated edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations
   of the novel.

   Austen might be known now for her "romances" but the marriages in her
   novels engage with economics and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice
   is hardly the exception.

   When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social
   differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome,
   though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within
   his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these
   differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what
   Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, "Will the shades of
   Pemberley be thus polluted?" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady
   Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating
   economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as
   gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are "equals"), Lady Catherine
   refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth.
   However, as the novel closes, "…through curiosity to see how his wife
   conducted herself", Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at
   Pemberley.^[253][22]

   The Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though
   Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst behave and speak of others as if they
   have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it
   clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley
   rents Netherfield Hall – it is, after all, "to let" – distinguishes him
   significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family
   and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an [254]earl.
   Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property but has portable and
   growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for
   poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious
   merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the
   characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the
   plot unfolds.^[255][23]

   An undercurrent of the old [256]Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at
   in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his
   aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; [257]Fitzwilliam, [258]D'Arcy, [259]de
   Bourgh ([260]Burke), and even [261]Bennet, are traditional Norman
   surnames.^[262][24]

Self-knowledge[[263]edit]

   Through their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and
   Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them.
   Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:

     "How despicably have I acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself
     on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who
     have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and
     gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How
     humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I
     been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But
     vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of
     one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning
     of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and
     driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I
     never knew myself."^[264][25]

   Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least
   are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.

   Tanner writes that Mrs Bennet in particular, "has a very limited view
   of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective
   tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and
   is only aware of material objects".^[265][26] Mrs Bennet's behaviour
   reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her
   daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. "The business of
   her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and
   news."^[266][27] This shows that Mrs Bennet is only aware of "material
   objects" and not of her feelings and emotions.^[267][28]

   A notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet's close friend
   and confidant. She accepts Mr Collins's proposal of marriage once
   Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her
   circumstances as "one of a large family". Charlotte's decision is
   reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.

Style[[268]edit]

   Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative
   technique of [269]free indirect speech, which has been defined as "the
   free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not
   words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the
   character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if
   she thought or spoke".^[270][29]

   Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and
   unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also
   considerably different.^[271][30] By using narrative that adopts the
   tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case,
   Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's
   viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. "The learning
   curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely
   through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is
   essential ... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck,
   within Elizabeth's misprisions."^[272][29]

   The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of
   another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this
   novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as
   through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge
   of Wickham's true character.

   Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from
   viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the
   "oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and
   work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic
   distance."^[273][5] Beginning with a historical investigation of the
   development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into
   empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool
   that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical
   distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a
   distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a
   scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a
   mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own
   original form.^[274][31]

Development of the novel[[275]edit]

   [276][lossy-page1-260px-Letter_from_Jane_Austen_to_her_sister_Cassandra
   %2C_1799_June_11._Page_2_%28NLA%29.tiff.jpg] Page 2 of a letter from
   [277]Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she
   first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First
   Impressions. [278](NLA)

   Austen began writing the novel after staying at [279]Goodnestone Park
   in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.^[280][32] It was
   originally titled First Impressions, and was written between October
   1796 and August 1797.^[281][33] On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent
   a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any
   interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return
   post.^[282][34]

   The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on
   Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks
   for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge
   camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several
   times.^[283][35]^: 57  The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment
   leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August
   1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were
   completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and
   1795.^[284][35]^: 56–57 

   Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First
   Impressions between 1811 and 1812.^[285][33] As nothing remains of the
   original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced
   to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it
   is assumed that First Impressions was an [286]epistolary
   novel.^[287][36]

   She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when
   she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to [288]Thomas Egerton
   for £110^[289][37] (equivalent to £7,800 in 2021). In renaming the
   novel, Austen probably had in mind the "sufferings and oppositions"
   summarised in the final chapter of [290]Fanny Burney's [291]Cecilia,
   called "Pride and Prejudice", where the phrase appears three times in
   block capitals.^[292][13]

   It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid
   confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of
   First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other
   works had been published under that name: a novel by [293]Margaret
   Holford and a comedy by [294]Horace Smith.^[295][34]

Publication history[[296]edit]

   [297][220px-Brock_Pride_and_Prejudice.jpg] Title page of a 1907 edition
   illustrated by [298]C. E. Brock

   Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the
   Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked for
   £150).^[299][38] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published
   [300]Sense and Sensibility on a [301]commission basis, whereby she
   [302]indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any
   profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense
   and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her £140,^[303][34]
   she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that
   all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has
   calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the
   first two editions of the book.^[304][39]

   Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three
   hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.^[305][40] It was advertised in
   [306]The Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.^[307][33] Favourable reviews
   saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in October
   that year. A third edition was published in 1817.^[308][38]

   Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French;
   subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and
   Swedish.^[309][41] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the
   United States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and
   Prejudice.^[310][38] The novel was also included in [311]Richard
   Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly
   edition of Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become the
   standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel
   are based.^[312][38]

   The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's
   novels. However, whereas her first published novel, Sense and
   Sensibility was presented as being written "by a Lady," Pride and
   Prejudice was attributed to "the Author of Sense and Sensibility". This
   began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit
   anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the
   anonymous author of all her then-published works.

Reception[[313]edit]

   Main article: [314]Reception history of Jane Austen

At first publication[[315]edit]

   The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first
   months following publication.^[316][39] [317]Anne Isabella Milbanke,
   later to be the wife of [318]Lord Byron, called it "the fashionable
   novel".^[319][39] Noted critic and reviewer [320]George Henry Lewes
   declared that he "would rather have written Pride and Prejudice, or
   [321]Tom Jones, than any of the [322]Waverley Novels".^[323][42]

   [324]Charlotte Brontë, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride
   and Prejudice was a disappointment, "a carefully fenced, highly
   cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no
   open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny
   beck".^[325][42]^[326][43]

   Austen for her part thought the "playfulness and epigrammaticism" of
   Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her
   sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked "shade" and should have
   had a chapter "of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected
   with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the
   history of Buonaparté".^[327][44]

   [328]Walter Scott wrote in his journal, "Read again and for the third
   time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and
   Prejudice."^[329][45]

20th century[[330]edit]

   Reveal so frankly and with such sobriety
   The economic basis of society.

     [332]W. H. Auden (1937) on Austen^[333][42]

   The American scholar [334]Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from
   the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.^[335][46]
   One critic, [336]Mary Poovey, wrote that the "romantic conclusion" of
   Pride and Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the
   "individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and
   the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic
   society".^[337][46] Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power
   structure capable of reformation was not an "escape" from
   conflict.^[338][46] Johnson wrote the "outrageous unconventionality" of
   Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen's own time very daring, especially given
   the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime
   Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrote Pride and
   Prejudice.^[339][46]

21st century[[340]edit]

     * In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the "[341]UK's Best-Loved
       Book" in which Pride and Prejudice came second, behind [342]The

   In [435]Gwyn Cready's comedic romance novel, Seducing Mr Darcy, the
   heroine lands in Pride and Prejudice by way of magic massage, has a
   fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story.

   [436]Abigail Reynolds is the author of seven Regency-set variations on
   Pride and Prejudice. Her Pemberley Variations series includes Mr
   Darcy's Obsession, To Conquer Mr Darcy, What Would Mr Darcy Do and Mr
   Fitzwilliam Darcy: The Last Man in the World. Her modern adaptation,
   The Man Who Loved Pride and Prejudice, is set on Cape Cod.^[437][71]

   Bella Breen is the author of nine variations on Pride and Prejudice.
   Pride and Prejudice and Poison, Four Months to Wed, Forced to Marry and
   The Rescue of Elizabeth Bennet.^[438][72]

   Helen Fielding's 1996 novel [439]Bridget Jones's Diary is also based on
   Pride and Prejudice; the [440]feature film of Fielding's work, released
   in 2001, stars [441]Colin Firth, who had played Mr Darcy in the
   successful 1990s TV adaptation.

   In March 2009, [442]Seth Grahame-Smith's [443]Pride and Prejudice and
   Zombies takes Austen's work and [444]mashes it up with [445]zombie
   hordes, [446]cannibalism, [447]ninja and ultraviolent mayhem.^[448][73]
   In March 2010, Quirk Books published a prequel by [449]Steve
   Hockensmith that deals with Elizabeth Bennet's early days as a zombie
   hunter, [450]Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the
   Dreadfuls.^[451][74] The [452]2016 film of Grahame-Smith's adaptation
   was released starring [453]Lily James, [454]Sam Riley and [455]Matt
   Smith.

   In 2011, author [456]Mitzi Szereto expanded on the novel in Pride and
   Prejudice: Hidden Lusts, a historical sex parody that parallels the
   original plot and writing style of Jane Austen.

   Marvel has also published their take on this classic by releasing a
   short comic series of five issues that stays true to the original
   storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was
   written by Nancy Hajeski.^[457][75] It was published as a graphic novel
   in 2010 with artwork by Hugo Petrus.

   [458]Pamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story
   of Pride and Prejudice from Mr Darcy's point of view: [459]Fitzwilliam
   Darcy, Gentleman. The books are An Assembly Such as This,^[460][76]
   Duty and Desire^[461][77] and These Three Remain.^[462][78]

   Detective novel author [463]P. D. James has written a book titled
   [464]Death Comes to Pemberley, which is a murder mystery set six years
   after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage.^[465][79]

   [466]Sandra Lerner's sequel to Pride and Prejudice, Second Impressions,
   develops the story and imagined what might have happened to the
   original novel's characters. It is written in the style of Austen after
   extensive research into the period and language and published in 2011
   under the pen name of Ava Farmer.^[467][80]

   [468]Jo Baker's bestselling 2013 novel [469]Longbourn imagines the
   lives of the servants of Pride and Prejudice.^[470][81] A cinematic
   adaptation of Longbourn was due to start filming in late 2018, directed
   by [471]Sharon Maguire, who also directed [472]Bridget Jones's Diary
   and [473]Bridget Jones's Baby, screenplay by [474]Jessica Swale,
   produced by Random House Films and StudioCanal.^[475][82] The novel was
   also adapted for radio, appearing on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime,
   abridged by Sara Davies and read by [476]Sophie Thompson. It was first
   broadcast in May 2014; and again on Radio 4 Extra in September
   2018.^[477][83]

   In the novel [478]Eligible, [479]Curtis Sittenfeld sets the characters
   of Pride and Prejudice in modern-day Cincinnati, where the Bennet
   parents, erstwhile Cincinnati social climbers, have fallen on hard
   times. Elizabeth, a successful and independent New York journalist, and
   her single older sister Jane must intervene to salvage the family's
   financial situation and get their unemployed adult sisters to move out
   of the house and onward in life. In the process they encounter Chip
   Bingley, a young doctor and reluctant reality TV celebrity, and his
   medical school classmate, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a cynical
   neurosurgeon.^[480][84] ^[481][85]

   Pride and Prejudice has also inspired works of scientific writing. In
   2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine
   darcin,^[482][86] after Mr Darcy, because it strongly attracted
   females. In 2016, a scientific paper published in the [483]Journal of
   Inherited Metabolic Disease speculated that Mrs Bennet may have been a
   carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't
   have any sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are so
   silly.^[484][87]

   In summer 2014, Udon Entertainment's Manga Classics line published a
   manga adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.^[485][88]
