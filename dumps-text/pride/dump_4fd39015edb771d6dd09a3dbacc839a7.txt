Historical Context of Pride and Prejudice

The Georgian Era

   Between 1797, when a young Jane Austen began work on what would become
   Pride and Prejudice, and 1813, when the novel was published, the French
   Revolution was fought, Marie Antoinette was guillotined and Napoleon
   rose to power and conquered most of Western Europe. Closer to Austen’s
   home, Great Britain combined with Ireland to become the United Kingdom,
   the slave trade was abolished by Parliament throughout the British
   empire and King George III, driven to apparent madness by what
   historians now suspect to have been a rare hereditary metabolic
   disorder, was replaced in his duties by his son, the Prince Regent,
   later to become King George IV.

   The Georgian era into which Jane Austen was born, characterized for
   Britain by almost constant warfare abroad, was in many ways a
   transitional period. It saw the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the
   shift from Enlightenment to Romantic trends in arts and letters, and
   the first whispers of feminist and abolitionist concerns in Western
   Europe. A little familiarity with these sweeping historical trends can
   lend some context to Austen’s domestic fictions, but perhaps more
   helpful is an understanding of the particular details of daily life
   during the Regency period; life as faced by Austen and so many of her
   fictional characters.

10,000 a Year

   From the 16th well into the 19th century, respectable wealth in England
   was accumulated primarily through the ownership of land. The land would
   be leased to tenants for farming, and the landowning families would
   live entirely off of the income generated by these leases. The families
   owning the largest of these hereditary estates, which varied in size
   but averaged about 10,000 acres, drew incomes sufficient to construct
   great parks and manors, purchase fashionable goods, retain servants and
   livery (horses and carriages), and meet other expenses related to
   keeping a country home. The most prosperous landowners also kept a town
   home in London, the social and political center of England, and lived
   there during the social season, January through July. The oldest,
   though not necessarily the wealthiest, of these families may have had
   some claim to nobility with inherited titles that gave “precedence,” or
   a higher rank at social functions in town or country. The term
   “aristocracy” referred somewhat more ambiguously to any keepers of
   London town homes whose social and political connections bought them
   seats in Parliament or influence in the royal court.

   In Pride and Prejudice, the Bennets are, like Jane Austen herself,
   members of an educated upper middle class known as the “gentry” or the
   “landed gentry.” Considered socially eligible to mix with the
   landowning aristocracy, but quite a step beneath them in wealth,
   resources and precedence, the landed gentry included country squires,
   military officers and many forms of clergy; all acceptable roles for
   the educated younger sons of the aristocracy and their descendants.
   Gentry may have owned less than 1,000 acres of land, may have leased to
   tenants or overseen the farming directly and typically lived in the
   country year-round, visiting London only to take care of occasional
   legal matters.

   Beneath the gentry were the laboring classes of household servants,
   tenant farmers, merchants and “tradesmen,” such as smiths and
   carpenters, village doctors, town lawyers and other professionals.
   Though lower in social standing because their income bore “the taint of
   trade”, many merchants and tradesmen might in fact amass considerable
   wealth and could wind up wealthier than the poorest of the landowners.
   This was especially true as the Industrial Revolution progressed,
   pouring more and more wealth into the trade and merchant classes.

   For the landowners and the gentry, management of all financial matters
   was a gentleman’s prerogative. By law and by custom, a woman was
   granted very little control over money, even money that we would today
   consider her own. A woman of the upper classes could expect to be
   granted a “fortune” from her family upon marriage or the death of her
   father. This lump sum of money would draw interest at a fixed 5 percent
   from investment in government funds, which would contribute to her
   husband’s income if she were married or would cover her living expenses
   if she remained single.

   A man’s income, by contrast, was always reported as a number of pounds
   (£) “per year,” such as Mr. Bingley’s “four or five thousand a year.”
   About £100 a year was the barest minimum income on which a small
   household could be kept, retaining only one maid—a servant being
   necessary to maintain any claim of respectability. On £300 a year, a
   small family could retain two servants and live somewhat more
   comfortably, but still could not afford a carriage, which could only be
   supported on an income of at least £700 a year. Mr. Bennet draws about
   £2,000 a year, which would be sufficient to keep the appearance of
   comfort and respectability; but he bears the financial burden of
   providing dowries for five daughters. However, his estate is “entailed”
   upon his death away from the family to be given to a distant branch of
   the family in lieu of a male Bennet heir. But an income of more than
   £4,000 a year, like Bingley’s, could well-provide for both country and
   town homes, with all of the modern comforts and latest fashions.
   Indeed, Mr. Darcy’s £10,000 a year has been calculated in recent
   decades to be worth between $300,000 and $800,000 in U.S. dollars;
   while another estimate, comparing Mr. Darcy’s income against the
   Regency average, gives him the real purchasing power of a modern
   multimillionaire.

An Accomplished Lady

   Some aspects of Regency life that have a strong bearing on the action
   in Austen’s novels are not necessarily given detailed description,
   because Austen’s first readers would already have been intimately
   acquainted with the highly formalized manners of the time. The custom
   of paying visits and leaving calling cards, for example, could consume
   the greater portion of a woman’s day, and many breaches of etiquette
   could spring from unreturned or improperly returned calls.

   In addition to beauty, mastery of etiquette, a sharp mind or a pleasant
   disposition, a lady could show her gentility through the display of her
   “accomplishments.” Accomplishments were sets of skills encouraged and
   cultivated in young women, skills which were thought to help make a
   home more lively, entertaining or beautiful. Common accomplishments
   included drawing, needlework, playing an instrument or singing well,
   and mastering languages. A woman with many of these skills was thought
   to be “highly accomplished,” and, evidently, more marriageable.

   Marriage, of course, was just about the only acceptable role for any
   woman. Women, like Austen herself, who passed beyond their youth
   without marrying became spinsters. They had no formal role in society
   and were occasionally a burden to their families. Even worse was the
   fate of educated young women of good standing whose fortunes were
   thrown in jeopardy by the sudden loss of their family. With no fortune,
   these women were nearly unmarriageable and might be required to enter
   the servant class as a governess of wealthy children in order to
   provide a living for themselves.
