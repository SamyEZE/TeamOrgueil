   Givenchy Parfums has launched an art exhibition in the metaverse to

   The digital art event will be hosted on Web3 platform Spatial from 22

   Givenchy described its current initiative as part of its "commitment to
   the LGBT to the LGBTQIA+ community during every Pride Month''.

   The three artists chosen include Vanille Verloës, a French digital
   fashion designer and artist.

   Her artwork for Givenchy is named 'L’Arbre de Vie' (The Tree of Life),
   and is said to represent an individual's personal growth and
   development.

   SamJ is an American non-binary artist, now based in Amsterdam, and has
   been named among the 100 most influential Web3 personalities by
   industry title NFTnow.

   'Engaged Dynamics', created for Givenchy Beauty, aims to reflect the
   artist’s personal experience of trans identity.

   Art by Edgar Fabian Frias, a non-binary artist based in LA, has been
   viewed than 300 million times on Giphy.

   Their piece named 'Chroma Nexus' is a 30 second GIF, in which abstract
   intensely coloured shapes come to life.
