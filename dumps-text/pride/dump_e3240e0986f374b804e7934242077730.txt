Republican attorneys general issue warning letter to Target about Pride
merchandise

   [107]Target pulls some LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise after backlash 06:18

   Seven U.S. state attorneys general [108]sent a letter to Target on
   Wednesday warning that clothes and merchandise sold as part of the
   company's Pride month campaigns might violate their state's child
   protection laws.

   Republican attorneys general from Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky,
   Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina signed the letter, writing
   that they were "concerned by recent events involving the company's
   'Pride' campaign."

   The attorneys said that they believed the campaign was a "comprehensive
   effort to promote gender and sexual identity among children,"
   criticizing items like T-shirts that advertised popular drag queens and
   a T-shirt that said 'Girls Gays Theys.' They also highlighted
   merchandise with "anti Christian designs such as pentagrams, horned
   skulls and other Satanic products."

   The letter also criticized Target for donating to GLSEN, an LGBTQ+
   organization that works to end bullying in schools based on sexual and
   gender identity. The company stated in a 2020 guide that school staff
   should not tell parents about a child's gender or sexual orientation
   without consulting the child first, something the attorneys general
   said undermines "parents' constitutional and statutory rights."

   The letter did not include any specific demands nor did it outline how
   they believe the campaign could violate child protection laws, but the
   attorneys general did suggest that Target might find it "more
   profitable to sell the type of Pride that enshrines the love of the
   United States."

   The attorneys general also said they believed Target's Pride campaign
   threatened their financial interests, writing that Target leadership
   has a "fiduciary duty to our States as shareholders in the company" and
   suggesting that company officials "may be negligent" in promoting the
   campaign since it has negatively affected Target's stock prices and led
   to some backlash among customers.

   Target shares have declined 12% this year, but the company is facing
   issues far beyond the backlash to its Pride collection, which included
   onesies, bibs, and T-shirts for babies and children. Like many
   retailers, the company is struggling with a pullback in consumer
   spending because of high inflation, which has weighed on its profits.

   But Target is also facing scrutiny for its merchandise selection,
   including its Pride line, with its stores removing [109]some of the
   items in May after facing threats. At the time, the company didn't
   specify which products were being removed, although Target has faced
   criticism online over swimsuits advertised as "tuck-friendly" with
   "extra crotch coverage" in its Pride collection.

   "Target's management has no duty to fill stores with objectionable
   goods, let alone endorse or feature them in attention-grabbing displays
   at the behest of radical activists," the attorneys general wrote.
   "However, Target management does have fiduciary duties to its
   shareholders to prudently manage the company and act loyally in the
   company's best interests."

   Backlash to the Pride campaign did involve [110]threats of violence to
   Target stores and workers. Some merchandise was relocated to less
   popular areas of the store, and other pieces, including the swimsuits
   criticized by the attorneys general, were removed.

   "Since introducing this year's collection, we've experienced threats
   impacting our team members' sense of safety and well-being while at
   work," Target said in a statement earlier in June. "Given these
   volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans,
   including removing items that have been at the center of the most
   significant confrontational behavior."
