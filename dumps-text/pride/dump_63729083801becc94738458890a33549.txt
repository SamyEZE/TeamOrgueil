Examples of Pride in the Bible

   Examples of Pride in the Bible are plentiful. However, there are three
   general characteristics that are described in the Bible for these
   prideful and arrogant people. There is one person who stands out as an
   example of pride in the Bible. That is King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.

General Examples of Pride in the Bible

1. The Prideful Tell Lies

   Those who are prideful will tell lies to make themselves look good.
   Anything to puff themselves up.
   proud, arrogant woman

   Now I don’t know if these prideful people start out with this intention
   or not. But we all have a sinful nature and when [30]our eyes see it as
   good, then we continue on that path. And one lie begets another and
   another.

     For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips, let them be
     trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
     [31]Psalm 59:12 ESV

   As we see from this verse, their words enslave them. A person who lies
   needs to remember all their lies so their story is consistent.

   These people have essentially linked up in following the darkness of
   this world. And the father of lies, who is Satan himself ([32]John 8:44
   ESV)

2. The Prideful Mock Others

   These people who are acting with arrogance have a name, according to
   Solomon. Their name is described by their actions.

     “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with
     arrogant pride.
     [33]Proverbs 21:24 ESV

   They openly mock others because they believe their views are subpar to
   their own. This is becoming more prevalent in this social media
   society. People are being “canceled” for not agreeing with their views.

   Being canceled is basically a form of rejection because our Christian
   worldview is being attacked. And we are not being allowed to have
   differing opinions.

   This is not new. As Solomon says, nothing is new under the sun. People
   have been canceled- aka rejected. And [34]Jesus is an example of
   someone who faced rejection on a daily basis. He can identify with your
   cancellation.

3. The Prideful are Deceived

   While the prideful appear In this life to have it all, they really
   don’t. And are being deceived.

     The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts
     of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, “Who
     will bring me down to the ground?”
     [35]Obadiah 1:3: ESV

   Example of pride in the Bible Pride robs a person of peace and joy

   This deception comes from their heart. They devise a plan that is evil.
   They think that their plan will give them the satisfaction that they
   desire. But in actuality, it robs them of the peace and joy that they
   are actually searching for.

     Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but those who plan
     peace have joy.
     [36]Proverbs 12:20 ESV

A Biblical Character Example of Pride: King Nebuchadnezzar

   In the story of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar sieged Babylon and took
   captives, including some youth. Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach,
   Meshach, and Abednego, were four of those taken. These young men were
   wise and considered better than all of his magicians in the kingdom.

   Even though Nebuchadnezzar was a success in his conquests, he was a
   troubled man. He had dreams that no one could explain. And he asked the
   wrong people to explain them – the sorcerers and magicians. He was
   unhappy that no one could explain the dream so he declared that all
   wise men should be put to death. Unfortunately, this meant that Daniel
   and his friends were in danger. Daniel asked for a meeting with the
   king to explain his dream.

   That night, God revealed the dream to Daniel. And the next day, Daniel
   explained how each type of metal on the large statue in his dream would
   outline the victories of kingdoms that are more powerful than the one
   before.

   After describing the dream, Daniel is promoted to the ruler over all of
   Babylon and his three friends were over the affairs of the province of
   Babylon.

Pride on Display

   So Nebuchadnezzar made a statue like the one in his dream and commanded
   everyone to bow down and worship this statue. If they did not, they
   would be put into the fiery furnace.

   But Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego, Daniel’s three friends, refused
   to bow down to the statue. So in an angry rage, the King had them
   thrown into the fire. They declared that God could deliver them from
   the fiery furnace if He wanted to but if He didn’t, they wanted him to
   know that they would NOT serve or worship the statue ([37]Daniel
   3:17-18 ESV).

   After being in a furnace, the counselors noticed there was a fourth man
   with them. And the king commanded that they come out of the furnace.
   Upon coming out, they were found to be unharmed and even their clothes
   didn’t smell like smoke!

   This amazed the king and he declared that no one should speak against
   their God because “there is no other god who is able to rescue in this
   way”([38]Daniel 3:29 ESV). The king gave glory to God for all that He
   had done for Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednego.

The King’s Second Dream and the Fall

   You would think that after that miraculous display, King Nebuchadnezzar
   would bend his knee and completely destroy the statue. However, he did
   not. He asked his magicians, again, to interpret the second dream. But
   they could not.

   So he asked Daniel to interpret it for him. The dream describes how
   Nebuchadnezzar would no longer be king and be dwelling with the beasts
   in the field. Daniel warned the king that he should repent of his sins
   and live in righteousness.

   However, the king did not do that. Twelve months went by and at that
   time, he declared how Babylon had success. And how it was all done for
   his glory.

   Immediately, the prophecy happened and Nebuchadnezzar was no longer
   king. And he lived in the field with the beasts. Some commentators
   believe that the king was mentally insane and imitated the behaviors of
   the animals.

   After a period of time, the king came to his senses, repented, and
   honored God. He said that God is able to humble those who are proud.

     Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of
     heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those
     who walk in pride he is able to humble.
     [39]Daniel 4:37 ESV

   Once he repented and humbled himself before God, he was restored as the
   King. And God blessed him even more because of his humility.

A Personal Example

   When I was prideful in my previous job, God humbled me. My job was
   eliminated and I had the choice to take severance and leave or take a
   position in another department. I chose to stay and moved to the other
   department. While it was a humbling experience, God taught me that my
   work is not about me. It is about serving Him and doing my best to
   honor Him.

   After two and half years, God opened up doors for me to take a job at
   another company. I have been restored to being a manager of people
   again and working for a company that is focused on cyber security. And
   I have been blessed even more in this position because I learned from
   that step of humility to give Him the glory in the work that I do.

   Are you walking in pride? Repent today, God is able to humble you as
   well.

An Advent Book: The Book of Luke

   picture of "prepare Him Room" book

   This advent devotional by Susie is different than most others. Most
   Christmas time devotionals are short and focus on the Scriptures one
   reads at Christmas. But this devotional contains the entire book of
   Luke – from the genealogy of Jesus, His birth to His death and
   resurrection.

   Susie’s writing is easy to read and it makes me feel like I am sitting
   in the room listening to every word over a cup of coffee or tea.

   Even though I received an Advanced Reader Copy of the book from the
   publisher, I am looking forward to soaking in every single word during
   this year’s advent season. Take the stress out of the Christmas season
   by making room for Jesus this Christmas. You won’t be sorry that you
   did! I liked this book so well that I bought extra copies for friends.
   I hope you will do so as well.

   This book is found on [41]Amazon or at other book retailer outlets.
