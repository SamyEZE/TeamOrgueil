   By [9]Norbert Juma | Updated November 14, 2023

   Our latest collection of ego quotes that will help you stay balanced.

   A huge ego is your worst enemy.

   An inflated ego can lead you astray and ruin your life.

   It can destroy your relationships, prevent you from recognizing
   opportunities, and inhibit true success.

   Granted, we all need [10]self-esteem and confidence to win in this
   world.

   But when confidence becomes arrogance, you risk ruining everything
   you’ve worked hard to build.

   If you allow your ego to take over, it can get in the way of living
   your life to its fullest.

   The good news is, you can stop it from bringing you down by adopting
   the beginner’s mindset, focusing on doing your best, and choosing
   purpose over passion.

   Instead of letting early pride lead you astray, remind yourself how
   much work is left to be done, not how much you have done.

   It’s okay to take pride in achievements or position but remember that
   nobody gets to the top alone.

   To help you stay balanced, below is our collection of inspirational,
   wise, and thought-provoking ego quotes, ego sayings, and ego proverbs,
   collected from a variety of sources over the years.

   Also, check out our most popular quote article, a list of [11]short
