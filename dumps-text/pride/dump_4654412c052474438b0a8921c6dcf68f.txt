   Pride is defined as a feeling of worthiness and, interestingly, it can
   be both detrimental and beneficial to an individual's personality.

   Generally, it is good to be [211]proud of yourself, as having pride in
   yourself will boost your self-esteem and self-worth, and perhaps even
   motivate you to achieve your goals. However, too much pride can be
   negative, remember the famous saying: "pride always comes before a
   fall"?

   Most pride is positive though, such as the pride that parents feel when
   their child graduates from college! So, let's celebrate ourselves and
   embrace being proud with this list of the best pride quotes that define
   this [212]quality in the best possible way.

   For more great quotes, check out these [213]stay humble quotes and
   [214]vanity quotes.

   16. "Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often

   motivated by pride and vanity."

   19. "The tyrant is a child of Pride, who drinks from his sickening cup

   pride."

   to hide our own hurts—not to hurt others."

   -Sarah J. Maas, 'Empire Of Storms'.

   29. "There had been an attempt to humiliate him. It had not succeeded.

   we don't give God the credit and we mistreat people, looking down on
   them and thinking we deserve what we have."

   -Joyce Meyer.

   62. "Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having
