   Three arrests were made Tuesday as protesters violently clashed outside
   a Los Angeles County school district building, where board members had
   convened to vote on whether or not to recognize June as Pride Month,
   according to the Glendale Police Department.

   Hundreds of people gathered outside the Glendale Unified School
   District headquarters both in opposition and in support of the school
   district’s LGBTQ policies. Anti-LGBTQ protesters waved American flags
   and chanted “Leave our kids alone” and the names of the five school
   board members. Counterprotesters waved Pride flags and held up signs
   rebuking anti-LGBTQ sentiments, according to the [80]Los Angeles Times.

   The board was about an hour into hearing comments from the public when
   police declared the protests “unlawful assembly” due to instances of
   physical violence, including unauthorized pepper spray use, police
   said. Attendees of the school board meeting were ordered to shelter in
   place, and police cordoned the building entrance with yellow tape.

   Glendale police [81]issued a statement saying that, “while most of the
   protest was peaceful, a small group of individuals engaged in behavior
   deemed unsafe.” Three people were arrested and removed from the
   protest. Just past 6 p.m., after additional attempts to de-escalate the
   situation were unsuccessful, the Glendale Police Department issued a
   dispersal order for the entire protest.

   After police dispersed the protests, the school board unanimously voted
   to recognize June as Pride Month. Nayiri Nahabedian, president of the
   school board, said at the meeting that this was the fourth year that
   GUSD called for recognition of Pride Month, according to the [82]Los
   Angeles Times.

   On Wednesday, the Los Angeles LGBT Center responded to the incident in
   Glendale, condemning the violence and thanking the school board for
   “standing by the safety and acceptance of [Glendale] students and
   families.” Terra Russell-Slavin, chief impact officer of the center,
   said in a statement to NBC News that community organizers reported that
   Glendale parents and educators who came to the school board meeting
   were largely supportive of the LGBTQ community.

   “Despite the uproar happening outside of the meeting, the School Board
   was simply voting on whether or not Glendale Unified should recognize
   June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month. What should have been an amicable
   meeting—even if there was disagreement among some community
   members—turned into a shelter-in-place order that frightened
   participants,” the statement reads.

   The center also pushed back against the notion, [83]popularized by the
   GOP, that LGBTQ-inclusive curricula in schools is harmful for children.
   It cited [84]the Trevor Project, which found that LGBTQ inclusion can
   reduce the risk of emotional distress and even suicide in youth.

   Topics of gender and sexuality in education have become a flashpoint
   for conservatives, who argue that these topics should not be taught or
   mentioned in schools. This rhetoric is fueled by an increasing number
   of [85]laws enacted across the U.S. aimed at restricting access to
   gender-affirming health care for trans youth and limiting discussion
   about sexual orientation and gender identity in public grade schools.

   Last week, an unidentified individual [86]broke into Saticoy Elementary
   School in North Hollywood, California, and burned a rainbow flag before
   a scheduled Pride-themed assembly. The incident is currently being
   investigated as a hate crime by Los Angeles police.
