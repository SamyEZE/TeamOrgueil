The meaning of Pride

   Fifty-four years ago, something important happened that changed the way
   people think about LGBTQIA+ rights. It started at the Stonewall Inn in
   New York City. The police used to arrest LGBTQIA+ people there just for
   being themselves. One day, the community fought back. They had enough
   of the discrimination and unfair treatment.

   These protests, known as the Stonewall Riots, lasted for several days.
   People like Marsha P. Johnson stood up against the arrests and fought
   for equality. Johnson became a leader and worked hard to bring
   attention to the issues faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. In the many
   years after the riots, she helped create organizations and policies
   that support LGBTQIA+ rights.

   Today, we celebrate this movement every June during Pride Month. Pride
   is not just about parades and celebrations. It's about recognizing the
   power and resilience of the LGBTQIA+ community. Pride is about family,
   community, accepting ourselves, being visible and embracing who we are.
   It reminds us that everyone has the right to be themselves and be
   treated with respect.

   At the University of Pittsburgh and beyond, being able to express our
   true selves is important. It allows us to be innovative, relevant and
   sustainable. When we can be our authentic selves, it brings diversity
   to our workspaces, enables us to ask important questions, speak up and
   make positive changes.

   Pride encourages us to break free from the stereotypes and biases that
   limit us. It reminds us that our identities are complex and should be
   celebrated. Sometimes society tries to make us fit into one narrow box,
   but Pride encourages us to be who we are meant to be — not just survive
   but thrive.

   Pride is for everyone, not just LGBTQIA+ individuals. Stretch yourself
   to come together, support one another and work towards a world where
   everyone is treated equally. How can you do this in your space and
   place of work? While we should practice LGBTQIA+ inclusion throughout
   the year, June offers many opportunities at Pitt and in the region to
   get involved and show support for the LGBTQIA+ community.
