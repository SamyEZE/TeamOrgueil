The Curse of Arrogance and Pride: An Islamic Perspective on Overcoming
Division

   Arrogance and pride

   In our social and cultural setups, the curse of arrogance and pride has
   infiltrated our hearts, fueling division and discord among individuals
   and communities. This destructive mindset hinders personal growth,
   erodes relationships, and tears at the fabric of society. However,
   Islamic teachings offer a transformative path towards overcoming these
   negative traits, fostering unity, and nurturing a harmonious
   coexistence.

   Arrogance and pride breed a sense of superiority, blinding individuals
   to the inherent worth and dignity of others. In our pursuit of worldly
   accomplishments, we often forget that true success lies in recognizing
   the greatness of the Creator and our own limitations as human beings.
   Islamic teachings remind us that Allah does not favor those who are
   arrogant or boastful, as arrogance stems from a false sense of
   self-importance and denies the equality and interdependence of all
   human beings.

   The curse of arrogance and pride manifests in various forms within our
   social and cultural setups. It manifests as elitism, where individuals
   perceive themselves as superior based on wealth, social status, or
   lineage. It fuels tribalism and racism, creating divisions based on
   ethnicity, race, or nationality. It fuels religious intolerance,
   leading to sectarianism and the marginalization of others based on
   differing beliefs.

Overcome the curse of arrogance and pride

   To overcome the curse of arrogance and pride, Islamic teachings offer a
   profound solution rooted in humbleness and humility. Muslims are
   encouraged to cultivate a deep sense of self-awareness, acknowledging
   that all blessings and abilities come from Allah. Instead of boasting
   about worldly accomplishments, believers are taught to express
   gratitude to the Creator and recognize the contributions and worth of
   others.

   Islamic teachings promote the concept of “[42]taqwa,” which is
   God-consciousness or mindfulness of Allah in all aspects of life. Taqwa
   serves as a safeguard against arrogance, reminding believers that they
   are accountable to a higher power and responsible for their actions and
   treatment of others. It encourages individuals to humble themselves
   before Allah, seeking His forgiveness, guidance, and mercy.
   Furthermore, the practice of “[43]Sunnah,” the teachings and actions of
   the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), provides a practical roadmap
   for embodying humbleness and humility.

   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known for his modesty,
   simplicity, and compassion towards all people, regardless of their
   social status or beliefs. His life serves as a shining example of the
   transformative power of humility in building bridges and nurturing
   harmonious relationships. In the light of Islamic teachings, the
   solution to overcoming the curse of arrogance and pride lies in a
   collective effort to return to the core values of Islam. It requires
   individuals to introspect, purify their hearts, and develop a genuine
   sense of humility. By recognizing the worth and value of every
   individual, regardless of their background or beliefs, Muslims can
   foster a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity.

   Islamic teachings call upon believers to engage in acts of kindness,
   charity, and service to humanity, seeking to uplift others rather than
   seeking personal gain or recognition. By putting the needs of others
   before their own and embracing the spirit of selflessness, Muslims can
   actively contribute to the betterment of society and counter the
   divisive effects of arrogance and pride.

   In conclusion, the curse of arrogance and pride poses a significant
   threat to our social and cultural setups. Islamic teachings offer a
   transformative solution rooted in humbleness and humility. By
   cultivating self-awareness, practicing gratitude, adhering to taqwa,
   and following the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him),
   Muslims can overcome the negative impacts of arrogance and pride. By
   embodying the values of Islam, we can nurture a society that promotes
   unity, respect, and compassion, paving the way for a harmonious
   coexistence and a brighter future for all.

   The main objective of the Islamic moral code is to create an “Islamic
   personality” that lives by its deep faith of loving, conscious
   submission to God, and is nourished by His divine love. These features

   from temptation, due to its fear of displeasing God.
