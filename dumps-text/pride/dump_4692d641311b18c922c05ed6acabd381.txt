11 Signs You Are Prideful

   How do you know you are struggling with pride? What are the symptoms of
   being prideful? To help you answer these questions and get rid of pride
   in your heart, evaluate yourself by checking out the following signs:

1. You think you are humble.

   One of the signs that you are proud of is that you refuse to admit that
   you struggle with pride. Therefore, calling yourself “humble” is
   actually false humility.

   To avoid this, stop telling yourself—or others—that you are humble. If
   that is true, then let others acknowledge that.

2. You do not accept constructive criticisms.

   Proud people have a hard time accepting failures. For this reason, they
   refuse to be corrected. They are offended whenever their behaviors or
   outputs are scrutinized.

   Instead of being insulted, be thankful when others correct you because
   it will help you improve. But, remember, you are not perfect.

3. You always want to be the center of attention.

   One sign of being proud is when you always want attention and
   appreciation. You feel like you are the center of the universe, so
   everyone should turn their eyes and ears to you.

   If this is your case, then it is time to stop living in the illusion
   that everyone adores you. Do not think that you are more important than
   anyone else. Instead, try living a low-key life.

4. You are vain about your physical appearance.

   Being obsessed about making yourself attractive is another hint of
   pride creeping into you. In connection with no. 3, vanity makes you
   flaunt your beauty, hoping that everyone will admire you.

   It is okay to take care of yourself and evaluate your motive for being
   attractive. However, if it is to draw attention to yourself, maybe it
   is time to re-orient yourself about real beauty.

5. You do not like associating with the “ordinary” or unpopular.

   Whenever you go to an event, which kind of people do you usually want
   to sit with? Do you immediately look for the table where the “elite”
   sit around? If you think you only deserve professionals and
   “first-class” citizens for your friends and avoid hanging out with
   “low-level” people, then you are clearly prideful.

   To get rid of this attitude, be equal in treating people. Make friends
   not according to social status, but the sincerity of individuals
   towards you. Associating with people who do not have any title attached
   to their names will not make you cheap.

6. You are fond of name-dropping.

   If you have the habit of talking about your connections with
   influential, rich, or powerful personalities, then you are certainly
   proud. Bragging about being connected with such people makes you feel
   entitled to yourself.

   The people you talk with are probably annoyed listening about your
   “connections” already. If you admit you struggle with this, be more
   conscious of controlling yourself from talking much.

7. You are not teachable.

   Not listening to someone who is trying to teach you something is
   another sign of pride. It is either you think you know things already,
   or you think you know more than the person. It could also mean you
   consider him/her inferior to you.

   Having a teachable heart is one trait of humility. Whether you seem
   more knowledgeable than the person trying to teach you or you actually
   know about the “lesson” already, make sure that you show respect by
   listening attentively and not trying to cut him/her off.

8. You do not listen to others’ advice.

   Prideful people are also stubborn. They think they know everything
   already, so they disregard the counsel of others. You are one of them
   if you brush off the advice of your parents, some elders, or anyone
   else.

   Renew your character by starting to listen to your parents or the
   mature people surrounding you. Even if you disagree with what they say,
   give time to weigh your decision against their words of wisdom.

9. You do not like to be surpassed by anyone.

   Considering others as threats to your position, fame, and success is a
   result of pride. Your achievements could have gotten into your head
   already that you think you should always be the no. 1. Thus, when you
   meet people who have the potential to beat your accomplishments, you
   consider them as rivals.

   Competition is only healthy if you compete with your past self. So
   instead of focusing on being ahead of others, why not focus on
   improving yourself?

10. You think you are too important to do mundane things.

   If you think your position is so high that you cannot pick up trash,
   help clean up, or serve others, that is definitely pride.

   Do not let entitlement make you feel like you are more important than
   anyone else. Great people are not afraid to serve those who are less
   fortunate than them.

11. You are critical to those who do better than you.

   One symptom of pride that you should watch out for is being critical
   towards others, especially those you are insecure with. Pointing out
   their flaws makes you feel better about yourself and better than them.

   Bitterness is the result of pride stepped on. Whenever you feel
   [64]resentment towards someone who did better than you, keep yourself
   from thinking or saying bad comments about the person. Instead, give
   appreciation and be happy for him/her.

Healthy Pride is Good

   Not all pride is bad. It can be good.

   Good pride is a healthy, positive attitude towards ourselves and our
   lives. It does not mean thinking we are better than others or that we
   should be treated differently.

1. Self-confidence is a good pride

   We should be confident, not arrogant. Confident people are realistic.
   They know what they can do well and try to do it often, but they also
   recognize what they cannot do and try to avoid those things.

2. Self-respect is a healthy pride

   This is the most important aspect of healthy pride. We should respect
   ourselves by respecting others. Treating others well helps us feel
   better about ourselves, while ignoring or mistreating others makes us
   feel worse.

3. A positive outlook on life

   If we believe our lives will be better in the future, we are more
   likely to make it so. Unfortunately, some people get stuck in their
   past and cannot see their lives getting any better. They have a
   negative outlook on life and feel trapped. This can be changed with
   some effort.

4. self-esteem

   We all have things we are good at and enjoy doing. However, we also
   have bad habits or skills that we can improve. Self-esteem includes
   recognizing both of these sides to ourselves.

   Healthy pride comes from within: we should be proud of what we
   accomplish without feeling that we deserve special treatment. Healthy
   pride comes from God: when he made us in his image, he gave us value
   and worth; he expects nothing less than excellence from us as well!

5. Optimism

   Optimists believe that good things will happen in their lives if they
   work hard for them. Therefore, we tend to be more optimistic when
   working towards something worthwhile rather than just trying to get
   through the day without too much trouble.

   Achieving goals helps us feel more positive about ourselves and feel
   motivated to set new goals because of this success.

6. Those with healthy pride lead, motivate, and inspire others.

   They do not use their success as a way to put others down. On the
   contrary, they want the good of everyone to be achieved and are willing
   to support the efforts of others towards this end.

   These people are committed, involved citizens and positive contributors
   in all aspects of society.

   They know what they are capable of, what they can achieve, so they try
   it. Others see this effort and self-confidence and want to be part of
   it, inspiring others to succeed in whatever way possible.

7. Being able to take care of yourself.

   Healthy pride means taking care of yourself and being grateful for the
   opportunities you have been given in life. For instance: being thankful
   for your family, education, job, etc. Having healthy pride means that
   you do not need to compare yourself with others – you are enough on
   your own!

   People with healthy pride can see their own flaws and weaknesses. They
   also have the ability to assess the value of others even more than
   themselves because they have a more realistic view of life.

   Because of this, they can make focused efforts to help themselves,
   improve themselves as well as helping others achieve their goals.


   This positive attitude allows us the freedom to pursue goals rather
   than just surviving or getting by on a day-to-day basis. In return, we
   may find happiness instead of sorrow when pursuing our ambitions!

What are the characteristics of an prideful person?

1) Being unthankful.

   Proud people are always asking for more than they have been given.
   Unfortunately, they consider whatever they receive as little and not
   enough, so they are never satisfied or contented with what they have.

   They think they deserve everything good that happens to them. When they
   get something, they regard it as a right, not a gift from others. As a
   result, they don’t appreciate what others do for them.

   When people are grateful, they appreciate and acknowledge what others
   do for them. Proud people overlook gratitude or do not have the
   attitude of appreciation. They don’t think about their family members
   as those who care and try to help them; instead, they only think about
   themselves.

   Their thankfulness is for themselves.

2) Being arrogant.

   Proud people put themselves above others and treat them with arrogance,
   disdain, contempt, and condescension.

   A proud person will speak to his spouse as if she were a servant or
   child rather than an adult equal in marriage. Likewise, he will talk
   down to subordinates at work as if they had no value except what he
   assigns.

   He gives orders and then treats them like dirt when they obey him—and
   maybe even when they fail to obey him for reasons beyond their control!

3) Being selfish.

   Prideful people think only of themselves and their own needs first, not
   about the needs of others around them who may be suffering. They often
   take advantage of others.

   They are not willing to help people who need it, even when they can do
   so easily.

4) Being defensive.

   A prideful person doesn’t like to admit that he has faults or
   weaknesses. He is defensive when anyone points them out, so he does not
   improve himself and correct his mistakes. Instead, he often blames
   others for the things that are going wrong with him.

   He may even blame other people’s success on their connections or luck
   instead of giving them credit for working hard and being intelligent.
   They make up excuses for why they needn’t change themselves even if
   they have problems in life.

   When someone doubts a great idea that the proud one has, he feels
   challenged in his superiority over others and becomes very
   argumentative in defending his opinion. Thus, he is certain of himself
   when he argues that only bad ideas come from stupid and inferior people
   like everyone else besides him!

5) Refusing to forgive others.

   Prideful people think that any injustice against them must be punished
   severely to feel better about themselves and especially to inflict pain
   on those who hurt them (even if they were the only one who was hurt).

   They focus on their own rights and think they are entitled to get back
   what others have done, or even more.

   Prideful people aren’t willing to forgive others who offend them, no
   matter how repentant they are or how much it would be for the good of
   their relationships if they did so.

6) Overreacting emotionally.

   When proud people experience something unpleasant, especially when
   someone mistreats them, they often overreact emotionally by acting out
   anger.

   They may yell at those around them without thinking about whether or
   not it is appropriate (like in front of children, you should not teach
   bad behavior). Or else the offended person withdraws into his shell and
   becomes distant, cold, and prickly.

7) Expressing prejudice.

   A proud person stops people from relating to him by being prejudiced
   and judgmental against them.

   He refuses to have friends who are not like him—in his race or religion
   or politics or other things he cares about above all. If someone is
   different (especially if they are inferior somehow), he will turn
   against that person rather than seek any good from their differences.

8) Jealous.

   Prideful people are envious of others and want to tear them down
   because those people have something good that proud people don’t get
   for themselves.

   When someone does something right, a prideful person thinks it is bad
   because it makes him look bad for not doing as well himself. So he gets
   upset at the success of others and tries to make them feel guilty for
   shaming him.

   Likewise, a prideful person feels bitter when someone gets a gift or
   good fortune that he did not receive. He is jealous of what others have
   or do and does not rejoice for them.

   They look at others with resentment when they are happy or doing well
   somehow—especially by having a better spouse or better kids or more
   money or a better job than the proud person himself has.

9) Bullying.

   Prideful people don’t like it when they feel small, so they will bully
   others into making themselves feel bigger. They are overbearing and
   tyrannical with those who don’t think or act as they do to maintain
   their ego.

   They are domineering and controlling with those around them who need
   guidance and training rather than bullying statements or commands to
   obey blindly without question.

10) Having an attitude of superiority.

   A proud person believes that he is superior to others in some way and
   thus looks down on them with scorn or contempt or something worse. He
   may not express this directly, but it will likely eventually come out
   in abusive words or deeds if this view lurks under the surface.

   Some people are proud of their money, success, social status,
   intelligence, physical characteristics such as strength or beauty
   (especially when they do not deserve these advantages), etc. These
   things can make a person feel superior and treat those who have less
   poorly to make himself feel better about himself.

Why is pride so sinful?

   There is nothing wrong with being proud of what you have achieved. For
   example, a good parent is proud of their child when they do well in
   school or win a sports competition. Likewise, you may be very proud of
   your car, house, or job, and rightly so – they are all achievements
   that deserve to be praised.

   But pride can become a sin when it turns into arrogance.

   The Apostle Paul, who wrote most of the New Testament, was an
   incredible man. He helped change the world with his writing and
   preaching and even had churches planted in some of the most difficult
   places like Corinth and Rome.

   Yet he writes to Timothy, ‘I have fought the good fight, I have
   finished the race, and I have remained faithful.’ (2 Timothy 4:7) –
   this is a humble statement from someone who has done so much for God’s
   kingdom.

   Pride causes us to think that we are better than others or that what we
   do is more important than others. It makes us believe that our
   achievements are entirely our own doing rather than recognizing the
   hand of God along the way. Pride stops us from thanking Him for His
   grace.

   When we are proud of our achievements, it becomes difficult to accept
   criticism or negative feedback because we don’t think we need any help.

   Pride stops us from serving others. When someone is arrogant, they
   think they are better than everyone else – so why serve others? They
   will look down on you for doing menial tasks, whereas if you were
   humble, you would serve others and do menial tasks out of obedience.

   Pride can indeed be a sin when we are proud of our achievements, but it
   can also be a sin when we are proud about who we are rather than what
   we do.

   It’s okay to say ‘I am good at mathematics’ or ‘I am an amazing
   singer,’ but if this becomes more important to us than saying, ‘Jesus
   sacrificed His life for me, and I have come to love Him deeply,’ then
   pride has set in.

   Pride stops us from being thankful for the incredible grace that God
   has given us. When someone is arrogant, they think nothing of thanking
   Jesus for anything – because they consider themselves so great! But if
   you were truly humble, you would be thankful for every blessing that
   comes your way, whether it be something as small as a cup of water or
   something great like the life of Jesus.

What do the Bible verses say about pride?

     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption, and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


     Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
     Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share
     plunder with the proud. (Proverbs 16:18-19, NIV)


     In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts
     there is no room for God. (Psalm 10:4, NIV)


     All who fear the LORD will hate evil. Therefore, I hate pride and
     arrogance, corruption and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13, NLT)


     And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes
     the proud but gives grace to the humble.” (James 4:6, NLT)


     do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is
     not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then
     you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted
     in.” That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief,
     but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.
     (Romans 11:18-20, ESV)


     One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will
     obtain honor. (Proverbs 29:23, ESV)


     When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
     wisdom. (Proverbs 11:2, NIV)


     The LORD detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will
     not go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5, NIV)


     Live in harmony with each other. Don’t be too proud to enjoy the
     company of ordinary people. And don’t think you know it all! (Romans
     12:16, NLT)


     Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those
     who take advice. (Proverbs 13:10, NIV)


     Let someone else praise you, not your own mouth— a stranger, not
     your own lips. (Proverbs 27:2, NLT)


     Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin. (Proverbs
     21:4, NLT)


     Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.
     (James 4:10, NLT)



Evaluate Your Heart

   Many other things could give you a hint that pride is attacking you.
   The bottom line here is your motivation. If you do things out of
   selfish ambitions, then you are definitely prideful.

   To [67]prevent pride from overcoming you, you must check your motives
   daily. It is important that you keep your feet on the ground, no matter
   how high you have reached already.

   God knows your heart, and if it is full of pride, He might teach you
   some lessons. Remember, the Bible says in Luke 14:11, “For all those
   who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
   will be exalted.”

   Thank you for truth. The Lord woke me up out of my sleep in regards to
   my behavior. I never knew I was operating in pride until the Lord
   showed me a reflection of myself . I had to repent and believe I will
   continue to do so in this area until Yah’s will be done in my life.

   came across this page and the truth shall set me free . Halleluyah
   sanctify us by your truth
   Today yah for his grace and mercy .

   How do you answer or respond like this? No offense, I just wondered bc
   Id like it if I could do the same – use the right /proper amount of
   words and or explainations instead of doing what I usually do – talk
   too much or long and respond with long , very detailed (like I am right
   now!!) and it may even seem unnecessary to the one’s who receive and or
   read it.

   Hello Sarah Miller, my name is Jacob Miller. And I just have to say
   that upon reading your comment here, I can’t help but instantly see
   myself in you (as so much that everything you wrote I too am very
   guilty of doing & have always wished I can do better & change or make
   an bigger effort in trying to stop doing. B/c everyone I’m talking to
   or attempting to share with either get bored and/or very impatient &
   begin urging me to try to speed it up & get to the point a bit faster.
   LMAO! I was just very taken aback at coming across a female version of
   myself in the comments here. AND even more so, is the fact that we ALSO
   share the same last name too! Very cute! Anyhoo, I wish you to have a
   very warming, loving, & fantastic rest of your 2021 year! 💯😇🤝👍🏻😉🤗

   My boy friend has all these qualities mentioned above. Yet he prides
   himself as being quiet, gentle and humble. Any time I point out his
   flaws becomes defensive and says that use my perception of him and it’s
   irrelevant. I’m really tired of his attitudes

   Sometimes a person can be proud of not being proud. hehehehe Many don’t
   realize they have it.
   There are several types of pride.
   And bad pride is sin. According to the Scriptures;” Pride goeth before
   destructions.. … Self-pity, self-condemnation self-exaltation, etc; ard
   members of being prideful.:)

   I see your point now but have not been able to see it this way in the
   past. Usually we only see or hear pride described as being too self
   absorbed, character traits that reflects too much like/love for self
   and whatever self wants , not the other way around. I never saw myself
   as prideful for feeling less than . I didn’t understand pride could
   mean not listening and or giving attention /time to other’s advice /
   suggestions. (proper/fair, which includes even when we do not agree
   with them or what they’re telling us. It might not be that other’s are
   ignoring you or deliberately putting you off, try to remember that
   we’re all in different places whether it’s Spiritually, mentally,
   emotionally, and or even physically- so, it very well might be that
   they are lacking knowledge, wisdom, intelligence, Spiritual fitness and
   or even no Spiritual guide / knowledge at all. Also , they may lack
   self awareness which definitely hinders us and leads to behavior that
   hurts others – but not necessarily on purpose. I know now that I’m
   guilty of this kind of stuff but my behavior/actions/words like this
   come from outside influences / sins of other’s. Maybe we were raised
   differently than they (person we consider prideful) were so whats good
   behavior as far as we’re concerned and or proper Godly actions /choices
   may not be familiar or even “Godly ” or proper to them at all. Usually
   followers of Christ have The Holy Spirit to guide them, direct them,
   teach them what’s good and truth versus what’s bad evil and lies . It’s
   helpful to keep in mind that we all mature Spiritually and emotionally
   at different places. I know I’m not as wise as some of the (most of
   the) other church fellowshippers / brother’s and sister’s in Christ
   are. I can focus on God and His Love for me (unconditional) and look to
   Him and only Him for answers to final decisions about life , love, and
   all things in between. ( We can all look to God for help with our
   emotional issues, our questions and fears pertaining to our mental
   health – help understanding better and or how God expects , wants/would
   like us to live with it . I feel like God is telling me to end my
   response here. I hope and pray you and other’s find it helpful in some
   way- I know God loves you and everyone else who reads this regardless
   of the reason any of you are here -taking interest, just happened upon
   it while searching – I have done this before and I like to believe God
   does it for His purposes , please believe that it isn’t just a
   coincidence or chance happening. Remember , you are not alone and
   Loneliness can confuse. We could be allowing untruths and or our lack
   of Godly wisdom and trust in God to bring negative thoughts about this
   into our minds . I used to see alone and or loneliness as very negative
   and bad and not welcome in my life at all ( if I could help it ). I
   felt or thought these negative things bc I saw or perceived it wrongly
   even thought about it in wrong ways that became irrational. God is
   teaching me the truth about it . His Word – the Bible is where we will
   learn – the old past way of seeing, thinking, and or believing will be
   erased and new ways , Godly ways , will take their place . An easier
   way to say that is like this- lies will be replaced with the truth.
   Only God can bring the understanding and make it real to your heart .
   He starts by bringing our mind and heart together ( one of the first
   things God does to help us) .

   This is a powerful reading and message to all for correction and
   identifications as known, pride wiggles into a person without knowing.
