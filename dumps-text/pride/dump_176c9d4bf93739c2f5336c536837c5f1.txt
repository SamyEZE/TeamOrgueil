30 Pride Quotes

   Answer this honestly. Are you proud or prideful? There’s a fine line
   between the two. Pride is an important part of who we are, it’s our
   self esteem for a job well done and it inspires us to push forward and
   do our best. But if your ego takes over, that power is lost because
   you’re not tapping into the humility we should all keep close. Enjoy
   these Pride Quotes; I hope they help you foster healthy self-esteem and
   build your confidence!
