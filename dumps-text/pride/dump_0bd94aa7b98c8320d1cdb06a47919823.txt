Pride Edinburgh is the longest running free celebration of the LGBT community
in Scotland.

   Since starting in 1994, Pride Edinburgh has grown exponentially.
   Coupled with the growth of digital channels we see our own digital
   presence as a vital part to engage with the community.

   Based on our community’s feedback and our ambitions we see the
   following as key areas of focus in the coming years:
     * Developing Pride Edinburgh’s value in the community by becoming a
       directory and promoter of LGBT life in Edinburgh and beyond.
     * Continue to grow the event to continuously improve accessibility
       and impact for the LGBT community.
