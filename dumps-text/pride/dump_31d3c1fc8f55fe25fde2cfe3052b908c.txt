   nonfiction texts. They are designed to develop detailed knowledge,
   in-depth understanding and genuine insight into each text.
   The guides are written by practising English teachers, professional
   writers, reviewers and academics who are experts in their fields. Each
   guide presents a clear, comprehensive and accessible analysis.
   There are over 150 titles in the Insight Text Guides series and new
   titles are published every year.

   EACH TITLE FEATURES:
     * An overview of the text for quick reference, including notes on the
       author’s life and work, a plot synopsis, a character map and brief
       character summaries
     * Discussion of the historical, cultural and social contexts relevant
       to the text
     * Close analysis of each chapter/scene/story, with chapter questions
     * Detailed analysis of characters, themes and ideas
     * Discussion of different responses to and interpretations of the
       text
     * Guidelines on successful essay writing
     * Essay topics, a sample analysis of a topic and a sample essay on
       the text.
