   With [109]Pride Month now upon us, festivities across the United States
   will create safe spaces while celebrating the lives and journeys of
   LGBTQ+ individuals everywhere. In addition to the countless Pride
   parades and festivities, queer creators and their art will also be
   centered this year – many art galleries, museums and other art spaces
   will be staging amazing art exhibitions, movie screenings and more
   throughout the month of June. Here are some of the best art events to
   catch.

Divine Queerness

   Centering around healing journeys, this exhibition at the Center –
   which celebrates its 40th year supporting LGBTQ+ community in New York
   City – brings together the work of seven artists. It includes the New
   York City downtown artist Lola Flash, originally active in Act Up in
   the 1980s, whose art sits at the intersection of race, sexual identity,
   ageing and social justice activism. Also on view is Mexican artist
   Gabriel García Román, whose vivid multimedia art presents layers of
   queer identity on individual portraits.

   The Minneapolis Institute of [111]Art offers a variety of events to
   bring Pride to museumgoers. Festivities kick off on 2 June with a
   gathering in the park capped off by a screening of Kiki, seen by many
   critics as a sequel of sorts to the landmark documentary Paris Is
   Burning, updated for an era of Black Lives Matter and renewed focus on
   trans rights. Another must-see event is the 22 June Pride Panel and
   Activations, featuring local artists including Kehayr Brown-Ransaw,
   Trista Marie McGovern, Julia Starr, giving them space to share details
   of the intersection of their artistic practices and queer identities.

Pride Not Prejudice

   A group show of 28 LGBTQ+ California artists, Pride Not Prejudice is
   the jewel in the Sausalito Art Center’s Pride festivities. The show is
   headlined by Homosocial, a project by artist Brian Van Camerik in which
   he takes photos of same-gendered couples and displays them in various
   forms, including homemade reliquaries, offering a deep dive into the
   many layers of queer relationships. The show also offers contributions
   from the Bay Area mixed media artist Dianne Hoffman, whose intricate
   boxes showcase repurposed and salvaged objects, and Ajuan Mance, whose
   artist practice draws from cartoons and breaks down stereotypes around
   Black individuals.

Pride: In Retrospect

   Art Museum

   The Newport Art Museum offers audiences a photographic journey through
   decades of the battle for civil rights for queer Americans. The exhibit
   offers special focus on the origins and timeline precipitating the
   Stonewall uprising of 1969 – largely credited with launching the modern
   fight for equality in the LGBTQ+ community – and the first Queer
   Liberation March of 1970, which marked the first anniversary of
   Stonewall and is widely known as the first annual June Pride parade.
   Images on display include activists marching at the 1980 New York Pride
   Parade, a memorial to the Pulse nightclub atrocity, and the historic
   Stonewall Inn.

Rainbow on the Eastside

   Seattle’s third annual Rainbow on the Eastside LGBTQ+ art extravaganza
   will take over Centro Cultural Mexicano’s Mi Casa location and its main
   office throughout the month. It welcomes a diverse group of over a
   dozen new and part artists. Newcomers include the queer Latina
   Anaïsysiria, whose work is typified by vibrant colors and large, bold
   shapes; Ariel Mei, a queer Chinese American artist whose practice
   centers on the beauty of the ocean and is informed by her pursuit of
   scuba diving; and Théo Nguyen, a queer Vietnamese American artist
   working in watercolors, gouache, pencils and the iPad app Procreate.

Take Pride! A Retrospective of LGBTQ+ Life in South Florida

   Fort Lauderdale’s Take Pride! offers a photographic exhibit during
   Pride month chronicling the struggle for equal rights in south Florida,
   as well as the development of the thriving LGBTQ+ community in the
   area, covering the 1940s through the present. On view of Galleria Fort
   Lauderdale, the show of photographs, video, archival costumes and more
   brings together pieces from the Stonewall Museum, the World Aids
   Museum, Key West Art & Historical Society and others. It includes a
   screening of the award-winning short film Open Dialogues, an oral
   history documenting voices from the LGBTQ+ community.

Pride at Whitney

   New York’s Whitney Museum offers multiple special events centering
   queer art and culture. On 5 June it honors the release of the HBO
   documentary The Stroll – chronicling the lives of the trans women of
   color who helped shape the city’s Meatpacking District – with an
   after-hours party following the screening of the movie at Gansevoort
   Plaza. On 9 June, the museum opens its doors to queer teens for a
   special evening of festivities, while on 17 June the Whitney welcomes
   The Piers Project for a special night of queer dance. And throughout
   the month, walking tours led from the Whitney will explore the queer
   history of the neighborhood around the museum.

WeHo Pride Arts Festival

   West Hollywood’s signature Pride celebration offers a month-long arts
   festival with exhibitions, marketplaces, performances and more. The
   digital art Angelic Troublemakers Exhibition runs all month at the West
   Hollywood library, while the Indigenous Korean American transgender
   artist Coyote Park shows their work at the One Gallery. Literary series
   WeHo Reads offers a night of literature on 14 June, featuring the
   writers Kamden Hilliard, K-Ming Chang, Golden and Natalie Wee, while 17
   June offers the LGBTQ+ craft market Beautiful Things at Plummer Park
   Community Center.

   The month is capped by a queer book bazaar on 24 June, with numerous
   vendors and performances.
